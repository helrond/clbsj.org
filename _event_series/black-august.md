In 2021, CLBSJ began participating in the "Black August" tradition. For five Tuesday evenings in August, we took a deep dive into the connections between our religious traditions and black-led movements for racial justice and social transformation. The theme of this innaugural series was was "Why Black Religion Matters" and it was co-sponsored by the Community of Living Traditions. 

In 2022, we again convened weekly during August, this time with a focus in on the connections between our scriptural traditions and the movement to end mass incarceration. 

Archives for both years can be viewed below. Stay tuned for plans for 2023!

## What is Black August?
“Black August” is a pan-African and internationalist tradition that recognizes the month of August as a living testament of the depth of commitment to transformation and liberation within Black communities around the world. From the beginning of the Haitian Revolution to the Nat Turner Rebellion; from the Fugitive Slave Law Convention and the foundation of the Underground Railroad to the March on Washington; from the uprising in Watts (1965) to the Uprising in Ferguson (2014); from the births of Marcus Garvey, Russell Maroon Shoatz, and Fred Hampton to the deaths of Emmett Till, W.E.B du Bois and Michael Brown — August bursts at the seams with histories of Black resistance. Because of this, organizers have claimed it as a month to deepen understanding of and commitment to the practices that lead us to liberation. CLBSJ is honored to unite with this tradition.
