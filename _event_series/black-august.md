_**A deep dive into the transformative and revolutionary aspects of Black religion.**_

In 2023, CLBSJ held our third annual Black August series, in which we explored the relationship between the struggle to overcome racism and the tradition of Black/Africana Biblical Scholarship. We learned from [Rodney Sadler](https://clbsj.org/events/2023/08/03/black-bible-scholarship-and-social-transformation/), [Ronald Charles](https://clbsj.org/events/2023/08/10/ronald-charles-on-decolonizing-the-bible/), [Shively T.J. Smith](https://clbsj.org/events/2023/08/17/shively-t-j-smith-on-anti-racist-biblical-interpretation/), [Renita Weems](https://clbsj.org/events/2023/08/24/renita-weems-on-womanist-biblical-interpretation/), and [Madeline McClenney](https://clbsj.org/events/2023/08/31/madeline-mcclenney-on-the-biblical-imperative-to-abolish-mass-incarceration/). As part of this journey, we also engaged with selections from the books [_Black Scholars Matter: Visions, Struggles, and Hopes in Africana Biblical Studies_](https://cart.sbl-site.org/books/0603112P) and [_Bitter the Chastening Rod: Africana Biblical Interpretation after Stony the Road We Trod in the Age of BLM, SayHerName, and MeToo_](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781978712010/Bitter-the-Chastening-Rod-Africana-Biblical-Interpretation-after-Stony-the-Road-We-Trod-in-the-Age-of-BLM-SayHerName-and-MeToo), as well as other materials.

Plans for 2024 are underway. Please check back for updates!

The series is curated by Hugh Page (co-editor of _Black Scholars Matter_) and Angela Parker (co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod_), along with Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Sherly Fabre, Warren Cooper, Carolyn Grice and Amy Dalton. Scroll down for bios. 

## Black August Series History
In 2021, as a way to act on our [Statement of Solidarity with Black Lives Matter Uprisings](https://clbsj.org/news/2020/07/13/statement-of-solidarity-with-black-lives-matter-uprisings/), CLBSJ began participating in the "Black August" tradition. For five evenings in August, we took a deep dive into the connections between our religious traditions and Black-led movements for racial justice and social transformation. The theme of this innaugural series was was "Why Black Religion Matters" and it was co-sponsored by the Community of Living Traditions. In 2022, we again convened weekly during August, this time with a focus in on the connections between our scriptural traditions and the movement to end mass incarceration. In 2023 we shifted our focus to the relationship between the struggle to overcome racism and the tradition of Black/Africana Biblical Scholarship, and were excited to welcome [Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary](https://www.jcsts.org/) as a co-sponsor. Archives for all three years can be accessed below. 

## What is Black August?
“Black August” is a pan-African and internationalist tradition that recognizes the month of August as a living testament of the depth of commitment to transformation and liberation within Black communities around the world. From the beginning of the Haitian Revolution to the Nat Turner Rebellion; from the Fugitive Slave Law Convention and the foundation of the Underground Railroad to the March on Washington; from the uprising in Watts (1965) to the Uprising in Ferguson (2014); from the births of Marcus Garvey, Russell Maroon Shoatz, and Fred Hampton to the deaths of Emmett Till, W.E.B du Bois and Michael Brown — August bursts at the seams with histories of Black resistance. Because of this, organizers have claimed it as a month to deepen understanding of and commitment to the practices that lead us to liberation. CLBSJ is honored to unite with this tradition.
