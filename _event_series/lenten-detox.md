This year, the Lenten Bible Detox Series will examine the biblical roots of theologies that separate humans from the rest of creation, which have often been misused to justify environmental devastation. In solidarity with urgent movements for climate justice and biodiversity preservation, we will excavate and reclaim a Biblical understanding of earth justice.

People of all faiths and backgrounds are welcome to participate. We will gather each Tuesday during Lent at 4:30 Pacific Time / 7:30 Eastern Time via Zoom for the opening session. Register for each session seperately at the links below. Check this page for additional details as they become available.

You can also access archives of past years' sessions below.
