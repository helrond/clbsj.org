Each Thursday during Lent at at 4:30 PST / 7:30 EST via Zoom

Lent is traditionally a time of discernment and fasting. Through
discipline, we seek to purify our awareness so that we are better able
help build a just and peaceful world. This Lent, CLBSJ is embarking on a
journey into some neglected spaces of Christian scripture, where texts have
become polluted with the confusions of human systems and weaponized
against justice, healing and peace. Join Brigitte Kahl, Sharifa Meytung,
Dong Hyeon Jeong, Rick Ufford-Chase, Ericka Dunbar, Norman Gottwald and
Crystal Hall in a weekly discipline of hearing, considering,
detoxifying, liberating and reclaiming these stories.

We will meet each Thursday at 4:30 PST / 7:30 EST via zoom. See below for the
full schedule. Click on the links to access additional details and registration
