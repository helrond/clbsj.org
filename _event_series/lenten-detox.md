2024 will be our fourth annual Lenten Bible Detox. Stay tuned for details!

Archives to past years' detox sessions can be found below. 

In 2023, the Lenten Bible Detox Series examined the biblical roots of theologies that separate humans from the rest of creation, which have often been misused to justify environmental devastation. In solidarity with urgent movements for climate justice and biodiversity preservation, we excavated and reclaimed a biblical understanding of earth justice.
