Lenten Bible Detox will return in 2022! We will meet **each Tuesday** during Lent at at 4:30 Pacific Time / 7:30 Eastern Time via Zoom. _**Mark your calendars and [resiger for the first session](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrf-6vpzkrE9YAzbuhnjv2nzQBZng54qpR) on March 8!**_

Lent is traditionally a time of discernment and fasting. Through discipline, we seek to purify our awareness so that we are better able help build a just and peaceful world. This Lent, CLBSJ is embarking on a journey into some neglected spaces of Christian scripture, where texts have become polluted with the confusions of human systems and weaponized against justice, healing and peace. Join us for a weekly discipline of hearing, considering, detoxifying, liberating and reclaiming these stories.

Speaker and scripture details will be forthcoming! Check this page for updates as they emerge.
