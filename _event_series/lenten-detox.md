Lenten Bible Detox will return in 2022! We will meet **each Tuesday** during Lent at at 4:30 Pacific Time / 7:30 Eastern Time via Zoom.

Do you have unresolved pain, anger, shame or even just plain confusion with regards to some parts of the Bible? For those who are deeply committed to building up the beloved community of justice and peace, it is often especially hard to reconcile the way that some parts of the scripture have been used to propagate human systems of oppression, war and cruelty. Often we just turn our minds away from these scriptures, creating a little compartment in which the discomfort can be tucked away. This Lent, CLBSJ invites you to turn back to these troublesome texts. In conversation with scholars and activists, we will delve into a series of Scriptures that have been weaponized against justice, healing and peace. 

We will meet each Tuesday during Lent at 4:30pm Pacific Time / 7:30pm Eastern Time for a weekly discipline of listening, considering, liberating and reclaiming these stories. Each session will open with a grounding practice led by [Sister Sharifa Vernice Meytung](https://clbsj.org/about/leadership/sr-sharifa-vernice-meytung/).
