This year, the Lenten Bible Detox Series will examine the biblical roots of theologies that separate humans from the rest of creation, which have often been misused to justify environmental devastation. In solidarity with the urgent movements for climate justice and biodiversity preservation, we will excavate and reclaim a Biblical understanding of earth justice.

Our [opening session on February 28, 2023 will be led by Gale Yee](https://clbsj.org/events/2023/02/28/reclaiming-the-bible-for-earth-justice-opening-session/). Other speakers will include Miguel de la Torre, Rachel Mikva, Presian Burroughs, Jamie Waters, Brian Tipton, Crystal Hall, Brian Kolia, and more to be announced. [Register for the opening session](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUud-utrj0jG9AKDqvHuYgOD63vFt4ect-Q) or check this page for updates!

People of all faiths and backgrounds are welcome to participate. We will gather each Tuesday during Lent at 4:30 Pacific Time / 7:30 Eastern Time via Zoom for the opening session. You can register for session 1 at the link below. Check this page for additional details as they become available.
