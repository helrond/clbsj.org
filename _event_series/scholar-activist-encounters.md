The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice invites you to join
us online each third Thursday at 4:30pm Pacific Time / 7:30pm Eastern Time

activism. How do these ways of being contribute to our understanding of
Scripture in the world today? Let’s come together to learn from each other.
