The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice invites you to join us for these interactive dialogues exploring the interfaces between scholarship and activism. How do these ways of being contribute to our understanding of Scripture in the world today? Letâ€™s come together to learn from each other.

Most events take place on the third Thursday of the month at 4:30pm Pacific Time / 7:30pm Eastern Time. We do not meet every month, and occasionally meet on a different night. Check this page for the latest opportunities!
