In honor of "Black August," CLBSJ is embarking on a deep dive into the
transformative and revolutionary aspects of Black religion.  We will
convene each Tuesday during August at at 4:30 Pacific Time / 7:30
Eastern Time via Zoom to explore the theme: "Why Black Religion Matters:
remembering and centering Black/Africana contributions to our scriptural
traditions." This series is co-sponsored by the Community of Living Traditions.

“Black August” is a pan-African and internationalist tradition that
recognizes the month of August as a living testament of the depth of
commitment to transformation and liberation within Black communities
around the world. From the beginning of the Haitian Revolution to the
Nat Turner Rebellion; from the Fugitive Slave Law Convention and the
foundation of the Underground Railroad to the March on Washington; from
the uprising in Watts (1965) to the Uprising in Ferguson (2014); from
the births of Marcus Garvey, Russell Maroon Shoatz, and Fred Hampton to
the deaths of Emmett Till, W.E.B du Bois and Michael Brown — August
bursts at the seams with histories of Black resistance. Because of this,
organizers have claimed it as a month to deepen understanding of and
commitment to the practices that lead us to liberation. CLBSJ is honored
to unite with this tradition.
