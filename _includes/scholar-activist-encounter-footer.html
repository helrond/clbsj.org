<p>The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice invites you to
join us online each third Thursday at 4:30pm Pacific Time / 7:30pm
Eastern Time for an interactive dialogue exploring the interfaces
between scholarship and activism. How do these ways of being contribute
to our understanding of Scripture in the world today? Letâ€™s come
together to learn from each other.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/events/scholar-activist-encounters/">full schedule</a>
of the Scholar-Activist Encounter series. For questions, email
<a href="mailto:info@clbsj.org">info@clbsj.org</a>.</p>

<p>This series is co-sponsored by the Community of Living Traditions.</p>
