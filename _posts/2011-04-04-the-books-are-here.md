[books]({{site.url}}/img/IMAG0419.jpg)The past two weeks we have been busy cataloging, labeling and shelving just over 800 books! We cataloged the books using LibraryThing, and the most current version of the catalog can be seen by clicking [here](http://www.librarything.com/catalog/clbsj).

Some pictures from the past few weekends are also [available on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/58998399@N00/sets/72157626431780512/).

We're looking forward to our opening in October, and looking forward to having you visit our library!
