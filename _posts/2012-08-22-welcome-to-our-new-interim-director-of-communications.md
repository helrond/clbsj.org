We at the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice are delighted to announce the arrival on our staff of our new Interim Director of Communications, Rev. Matthew Johnstone.

Rev. Johnstone received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Classics from Middlebury College, and completed his Master of Divinity at Princeton Theological Seminary. He is an ordained Teaching Elder in the Presbyterian Church (USA), and currently serves also as the Pastor of Scotchtown Presbyterian Church in Middletown, NY.

Of his own reasons for joining in the work of the Center and Library, he says, “There is no more critical conflict in the so-called ‘culture wars’ than the perceived differences between Christians devoted to social justice and those dedicated to the authority of Scripture. This is a false dichotomy - and the Center and Library can go a long way to helping manage and resolve this wholly unnecessary conflict.”

The Interim Director of Communications has been tasked by our Board with creating and implementing a new communications package and strategy for the Center and Library; supporting the ministry of the Board and Center and Library Staff at Stony Point; facilitating conferences and other outreach events sponsored by the Center and Library; and developing a stewardship and fundraising campaign to support the Center and Library in the years to come.

We would also like to be sure to remind everyone of the [upcoming seminar](http://clbsj.org/?p=417) here at the CLBSJ at the Stony Point Center on September 29. Our topic is “A Seminar on the Bible and Social Justice: What does the Bible really say about politics?” The seminar is presented in association with the Newark School of Theology, and features keynote speakers Dr. Norman Gottwald and Dr. Obery Hendricks.
