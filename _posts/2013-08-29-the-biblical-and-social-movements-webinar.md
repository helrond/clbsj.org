Bartimaeus Cooperative Ministries has made a webinar, recorded on July 20<sup>th</sup>, 2013 entitled “The Bible and Social Movements: Ched Myers Interviews Dr. Norman Gottwald” exclusively available to visitors to this CLBSJ site.  Gottwald is a pioneering biblical scholar in Old  Testaments, whose life and vocation was deeply shaped by social movements, and conversely, whose exegetical work has inspired many activists. Myers (one of those who has been so inspired) interviews Norm about how his socio-political approach to the Scriptures has, and can, empower faith-based witness, and about the recent establishment of The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice at Stony Point, NY, a  resource for clergy, activists and theologians.
