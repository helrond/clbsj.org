Akin to the Hebrew prophets, we live at a time of monumental change and challenge.  In this workshop we studied the prophetic witness in the Hebrew Scriptures to help  us meet the challenges of our day with courage, insight and vision.

## Breaking the Silence

_Plenary by Walter Brueggemann_

We live in a world in which market forces and the socio-political structures they create present themselves as the only viable system, silencing all alternative conversations. Dr. Brueggemann analyzes how the prophets broke through the domineering structures of their day to bring a message of judgment and hope. Dr. Brueggemann applies the lessons of the prophets to the challenges of our day.
