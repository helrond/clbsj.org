Tim Woods has written a reflection on the ["Sheep and the Goats" parable](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46) from Matthew 25 over on [KAIROS's](http://clbsj.org/about/affiliated-organizations/kairos/) website. It discusses interpretations of the reading from three different perspectives: students at The Kingâ€™s University in Edmonton, Alberta; a base community gathering in Lake Nicaragua, Nicaragua; and the theologian Andrew Bandstra. It's an engaging read that's more than worth your time.
