Join resident scholar Norman Gottwald to discuss his seminal book and its
continuing relevance for today's movements against poverty and for poor people's
liberation.

On September 13th, Community of Living Traditions Christian Cohort member and
resident scholar Norman Gottwald will discuss his book _Tribes of Yahweh: A
Sociology of the Religion of Liberated Israel, 1250-1050 BCE_. Published in 1979,
this seminal book changed hearts, minds and power relations in biblical
scholarship and social action. The evening will also feature reflections from
Laura Gottwald, Rabbi Michael Feinberg, Dr. Douglass Bendall, and others on
reading the book in various applied contexts, followed by an open discussion
about the book's relevance for today's movements against poverty and for poor
people's liberation.
