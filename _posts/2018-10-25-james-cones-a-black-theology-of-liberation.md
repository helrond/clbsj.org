Join the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice to discuss James
Cone's seminal book and it's continuing relevance for today's movements for
racial justice and liberation theology.

Join the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice and the Community
of Living Traditions for the second gathering in a series exploring books that
changed hearts, minds and power relations in scholarship and social action. Nkosi
DuBois Anderson, who served as Dr. Cone's research assistant for six years prior
to his death, will be joined by pastors Valerie Anne Ross and Nicholas A. Johnson
to discuss James Cone's seminal book, _A Black Theology of Liberation_ (1970),
followed by a facilitated discussion about the book's relevance for today's
movements for racial justice and black liberation.
