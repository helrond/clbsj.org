Join us for our next Seminal Books conversation. We will be joined by members of the Community of Living Traditions at the Stony Point Center (Christian co-hort) who will share with us their "Seminal Books" and how it connects to their lives as readers of the Bible and Activists. 

All are welcome to join us at the Library on campus or via livestream. If you would like to connect via livestream, join us on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/clbsj/).
