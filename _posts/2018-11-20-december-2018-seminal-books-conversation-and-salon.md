Join us this month on as Rick and Kitty Ufford-Chase lead us in a conversation on the work of Jim Corbett's Seminal Books, "Sanctuary for All Life" and "Goatwalking." Our conversation will center on Sanctuary, immigration, earth-centered activism and where we are today. 
Jim Corbett was a Quaker, thought of himself equally as a practicing mystic and an uncompromising activist.  His deep thinking and ministry inspired many to deepen their faith-rooted organizing practices centered in human and community dignity.
