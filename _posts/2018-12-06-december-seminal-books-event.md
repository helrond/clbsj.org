Join Kitty and Rick Ufford-Chase, the co-directors at Stony Point Center, who will lead a discussion about on Jim Corbett's seminal book, "Sanctuary for All Life" and "Goatwalking."
 
Jim was a Quaker who is considered a co-founder of the original
Sanctuary Movement. Equally a practicing mystic and an uncompromising
activist, his philosophy and ministry inspired many to deepen their
faith-rooted organizing practices centered in human and community dignity.
 
Rick and Kitty's comments will draw from their direct experience of
working with Jim Corbett on the border. The conversation will focus on
how Jim's ideas have impacted immigrant rights and Sanctuary organizing,
as well as earth-centered activism, and how it continues to speak today.
 
The event begins at 7pm in the Center and Library for Social Justice on
the Stony Point Center Campus. For those unable to attend in person, the
event will be livestreamed on the CLBSJ facebook page:

This event is the third in a salon series called "Seminal Books in
Activist Theology," organized by the Center and Library for the Bible
and Social Justice and the Community of Living Traditions at Stony Point
Center. For one Thursday a month, bibliophiles, activists, theologians
and scholars of all stripes are invited to gather at the Library and
discuss books that helped to galvanize faith-based consciousness in
movement.
