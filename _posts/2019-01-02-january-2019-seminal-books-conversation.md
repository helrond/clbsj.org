description: January 2019 Seminal Books Conversation in Feminist Theology
---
For our January Seminal Books conversation, we will be featuring a roundtable conversation about books in feminist theology. By feminist, we mean all books coming out of women's writing and theological work. 

A few women connected with the Library will discuss their personal seminal books that were part of their early formation in liberation, activism and theology and we will invite conversation with those gathered and online. 

Those leading up the conversations will be the Rev. Emily Brewer, Executive Director of the [Presbyterian Peace Fellowship](https://www.presbypeacefellowship.org), along with the Rev. Sarah Henkel and Amy Dalton of the [Community of Living Traditions](https://stonypointcenter.org/multifaith-community) at [Stony Point Center](https://stonypointcenter.org). Amy Dalton is also one of our CLBSJ Board Members! 

The conversation will be held on Thursday January 10, 2019 at 7PM at the Library, 5 Crickettown Road Stony Point, NY and will be live-streamed on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/clbsj/) page.
