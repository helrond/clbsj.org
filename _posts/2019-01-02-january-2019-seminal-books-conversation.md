title: 'January 2019 Seminal Books Conversation '
author: Shannan Vance-Ocampo
location: '5 Crickettown Road Stony Point, NY 10980'
description: >-
  For our January Seminal Books conversation, we will be featuring a roundtable
  conversation about books in feminist theology. By feminist, we mean all books
  coming out of women's writing and theological work. A few women connected with
  the Library will discuss their personal seminal books that were part of their
  early formation in liberation, activism and theology and we will invite
  conversation with those gathered and online. Those leading up the
  conversations will be the Rev. Emily Brewer, Executive Director of the
  Presbyterian Peace Fellowship, along with the Rev. Sarah Henkel and Amy Dalton
  of the Community of Living Traditions at Stony Point Center. Amy Dalton is
  also one of our CLBSJ Board Members! The conversation will be held on Thursday
  January 10, 2019 at 7PM at the Library, 5 Crickettown Road Stony Point, NY and
  will be live-streamed on our Facebook page.
