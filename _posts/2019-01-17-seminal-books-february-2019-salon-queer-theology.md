On February 14, we will continue our Seminal Books Salon Series in which we discuss books that have influenced movements. This month, in honor of Valentine’s Day, the theme will be “Queer Liberation Theology & Love.”

This month, Rev. Eric A. Thomas of Siloam Presbyterian Church will discuss how he was impacted by two books: No Ashes in the Fire: Coming of Age Black and Free in America by Darnell L. Moore, and Bible Trouble: Queer Reading at the Boundaries of Biblical Scholarship edited by Teresa Hornsby and Ken Stone. His comments will be followed by a roundtable discussion.

Eric A. Thomas a PhD candidate in New Testament and Early Christianity at Drew University. His research focuses on Minoritized Biblical Criticism informed by Queer Theory.  Eric is a graduate of the Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC) in Atlanta, GA, and is currently the Interim Pastor of Siloam Presbyterian Church in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.  His essays “Tales from the Crypt: A Same Gender Loving (SGL) Reading of Mark 5:1-20 – Backwards” and “The Futures Outside (Rev 22:8-21): Apocalyptic Epilogue Unveiled as Africana Queer Prologue” are published in the Journal of the ITC and in Sexual Disorientations: Queer Temporalities, Affects, Theologies (Fordham University Press) respectively.  When not working on his dissertation, he enjoys spending time with his husband Carlos Barnett, and being the proud uncle of Jayden, Nia and Devin.

Each month we invite a roundtable of scholar/activists to share about books related to a particular theme that sparked their own personal spiritual/activist awakening, and then we reflect together. 

The conversation will be held on at 7PM at the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice on the campus of the [Stony Point Center](https://stonypointcenter.org), 5 Cricketown Road Stony Point, NY and live-streamed on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/clbsj/) page.
