On February 14, we will continue our Seminal Books Salon Series in which we discuss books that have influenced movements. This month, in honor of Valentine’s Day, the theme will be “Liberating Love - LGBTQIA Theology & Biblical Hermeneutics.”

Each month we invite a roundtable of scholar/activists to share about books related to a particular theme that sparked their own personal spiritual/activist awakening, and then we reflect together. 

The conversation will be held on at 7PM at the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice on the campus of the [Stony Point Center](https://stonypointcenter.org), 5 Cricketown Road Stony Point, NY and live-streamed on our [Facebook page](www.facebook.com/clbsj). 

The Seminal Books in Activist Theology Series is sponsored by the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice and the [Community of Living Traditions](https://stonypointcenter.org/multifaith-community) at Stony Point Center.
