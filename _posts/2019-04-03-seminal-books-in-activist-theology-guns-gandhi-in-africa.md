On April 11, 2019, we will continue our Seminal Books Salon Series in which we discuss books that have influenced movements.

This month, we will be considering the seminal book [Guns & Gandhi in Africa: Pan African Insights on Nonviolence](http://africaworldpressbooks.com/guns-and-gandhi-in-africa-pan-african-insights-on-nonviolence-armed-struggle-and-liberation-in-africa-by-bill-sutherland-and-matt-meyer/), Armed Struggle and Liberation in Africa, co-authored by Bill Sutherland and Matt Meyer and published by Africa World Press. This collection of writings examines the strategies and tactics used in the movements to end to colonialism, and chronicles the history of an often invisible Pan-Africanist peace perspective.

Our speakers will be Matt Meyer and Eben Egbe who are activists with the Fellowship of Reconciliation and longtime African solidarity organizers. Matt will speak about the process of writing and gathering the materials contained in the book, and share about his experience of working with his co-author, the late Bill Sutherland. Eben will speak from the perspective of an African diaspora activist who has put the ideas outlined in this book to use multiple times.

In the Foreword of Guns and Gandhi, Archbishop Desmond Tutu wrote that Sutherland and Meyer “have looked beyond the short-term strategies and tactics which too often divide progressive peoples…They have begun to develop a language which looks at the roots of our humanness.”

We are especially honored to host this event during the year which would have been [“Baba Bill’s”](https://www.warresisters.org/bill-sutherland-1918-2010) 100th birthday.

The conversation will be held on at 7PM at the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice on the campus of Stony Point Center, 5 Cricketown Road Stony Point, NY and offered over video-conference. If you would like to join the video conference, please visit [https://zoom.us/j/7328959083](https://zoom.us/j/7328959083) at that time.
