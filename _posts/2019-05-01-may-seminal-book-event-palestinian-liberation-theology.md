On May 9, 2019, we will continue our Seminal Books Salon Series in which we discuss books that have influenced movements.

This month, we will be considering the seminal book Faith and the Intifada: Palestinian Christian Voices by Naim Ateek. 

Our speaker will be Rani Allan, a 2018 graduate of Hunter College, co-founder of the Palestine Solidarity Alliance at Hunter College, as well as former President. He is a Palestinian-American activist, born in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and grew up in Egypt. He graduated with a major in Political Science alongside a certificate in Human Rights. His activism focuses on Palestine liberation, mental health, and cross-movement building. Rani is an aspiring civil rights lawyer. During his time at Hunter, he co-founded the Apartheid Divest CUNY campaign that targeted the largest urban university system in the country and made the University Chancellor make a phone call after midnight panicking about it.

The conversation will be held on at 7PM at the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice on the campus of Stony Point Center, 5 Cricketown Road Stony Point, NY and offered over video-conference. If you would like to join the video conference, please visit https://zoom.us/j/7328959083 at that time.

The Seminal Books in Activist Theology Series is sponsored by the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice and the Community of Living Traditions at Stony Point Center. Please mark your calendars for our next Seminal Books Salon, all at 7PM at the Library and online:
