Two CLBSJ board members have recently published articles which connect Biblical passages to the world we live in:
- Read Ched Myers' essay ["Jesus' risen, mutilated body"](https://www.christiancentury.org/article/critical-essay/jesus-risen-mutilated-body), published recently by _The Christian Century_.
- Jennifer Henry published a blog post titled ["Choose Life: Protecting our Oceans in these times"](https://www.kairoscanada.org/choose-life-protecting-our-oceans-in-these-times) on the KAIROS blog.
