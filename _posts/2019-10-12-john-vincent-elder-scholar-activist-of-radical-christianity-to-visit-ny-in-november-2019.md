The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice, Jersey City
Together, New York Theological Seminary and the Urban Theology Unit
North America are pleased to welcome Rev. Dr. John Vincent for a series
of seminars and discussions on contextual urban ministry in the greater
NYC region. John is a minister, scholar and social justice organizer
whose Bible-based work has built enormous capacity for liberation
theology in his home of Sheffield, England and beyond. During his visit
he will engage different audiences that are doing forms of contextual
urban ministry, and will particularly share about his emerging approach
to Biblical interpretation, which he calls Practice Interpretation
Methodology. Our hope is that his visit to the greater NYC region will
create a unique opportunity for transnational strategizing and knowledge
exchange amongst Biblically-informed activists and justice-oriented
scholars.
