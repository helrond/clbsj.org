There should be a warning at the beginning of the book Radical Jesus:
Read only if you are willing to have your life and your idea of the
“way” of Jesus shaken and challenged. John Vincent states in his poem _To
You, Radical Jesus_:

“A radical goes to the roots,  
Finds out the base of things,  
Lives by the original source,  
Cuts out additions, revisions, rationalizations,  
Goes back to the basic beginnings.”

This is the Jesus of this book. Vincent calls him Alternative, Guru,
Master, Blasphemer, Politician, Counter-politician and the Journey
Downward. He tells of the life of Jesus in a straight-forward, no
nonsense, manner. The book easy to read but less easy to appropriate.
Vincent gives us the stark reality of Jesus life, but he does not leave
us hanging.

An impressive mixture of contextual Biblical interpretation and
devotional journey, the chapters intersperse socio-historical analysis
of Jesus's context with reflections on how those details are relevant in
today's struggles for dignity from the bottom of society. In the later
portion of his book he offers concrete actions that we might take if we
want to be true disciples of this Radical Jesus. Vincent includes a
study guide for how to read the book alongside the Gospel of Mark. He
encourages the use of the book in groups or by individuals.

_Radical Jesus_ should be for Christian activists as _Rules for Radicals_ is for organizers -- a foundational text.
