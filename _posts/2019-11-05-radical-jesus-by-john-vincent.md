On November 5, 2019, we will continue our Seminal Books Salon Series in which we
discuss books that have influenced movements.

The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice (CLBSJ) has nearly a
dozen books by [Rev. Dr. John Vincent](https://clbsj.org/news/2019/10/12/introducing-john-vincent-radical-mark-sist/)
on its shelves, donated by Walter Wink, Norman Gottwald, Ed Long, and the Urban
Theology Unit. As such, we are honored to host Rev. Vincent in person to discuss
his seminal book, _Radical Jesus: The Way of Jesus Then and Now_, first published
in 1986.

An impressive mixture of contextual Biblical interpretation and devotional
journey, _Radical Jesus_ intersperses socio-historical analysis of Jesus’s context
with reflections on how those details are relevant in today’s struggles for
dignity from the bottom of society. For more about the book, read the
[full review](/news/2019/10/15/book-review-radical-jesus-the-way-of-jesus-then-and-now-by-john-vincent/)
by Norman Gottwald and Amy Dalton.

The book talk will be held on at 7:15pm at the Center and Library for the Bible
and Social Justice on the campus of Stony Point Center — 5 Cricketown Road,
Stony Point, NY — and offered over video-conference. If you would like to join
the video conference, please visit https://zoom.us/j/369465199 at that time.
