This addition to our library will be of particular interest to the
multifaith Community of Living Traditions at Stony Point Center, because
it shows precisely how the Jesus followers remained thoroughly Jewish,
and, moreover, that there was a Jewish presence alongside Gentile
converts well into the first three centuries, C.E.

The Jesus-followers gathered in Jerusalem and met regularly in the
temple, and followed most, if not all, of existing Jewish mainstream
practices. These folks were opposed to the Jewish uprising in 66-72 C.E.
but so did many other Jews. The Jewish Jesus followers were keepers of
the law, and were at first disturbed at the conversion of Gentiles to
their movement. According to Paul in the book of Acts, the Jewish Jesus
followers were eventually persuaded of the legitimacy of these converts
without being circumcised or observing the whole Torah. According to
Acts, the Gentile converts abstained from idol worship and eating bloody
meat.

The author rehearses a lot of the background history of Jewish-Roman
rule as she traces the stages and factors in the emergence of the Jesus
movement as an aspect of Jewish reality.

Indicative of the mixed attitude toward the Jesus followers is the
speech attributed to Gamaliel, a leading pharisee in the Jewish
assembly, expresses the openness of some Jews to the Jesus followers.
Speaking to the council regarding Peter and the apostles he declares,
"Men of Israel! Take care of what you do too these men...keep away from
them and leave them alone, for if this undertaking is of men, it will
fail, but if it is of God you will not be able to overthrow them. You
might even be found opposing God! (Acts 5:35, 38-39)."
