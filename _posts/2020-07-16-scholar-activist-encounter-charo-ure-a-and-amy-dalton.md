join us online each third Thursday at 4:30pm Pacific Time / 7:30pm

between scholarship and activism. How do these ways of being contribute
to our understanding of Scripture in the world today? Let’s come
together to learn from each other.

In this session, faith-rooted organizers Amy Dalton and Rosarion "Charo"
Ureña will discuss their work within the immigrant rights movement,

Rosario "Charo" Urena is a minister, organizer and the founding director
of Proyecto Faro, an immigrant-led organizing project based in Stony
Point, NY. A Dominican immigrant who has experienced being undocumented
in the United States, her passion for social justice was catalyzed by
the experience of advocating for her mobile home community after it was
flooded during Hurricane Sandy. She has extensive church leadership
experience — including as a cell leader, transportation director, food
pantry director, events and retreats coordinator, and missions trip
coordinator — which she puts to use in her organizing work. She is a
graduate of the Kairos Course, having been sponsored by Redemptive Word
Ministry in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She enjoys spending time with her two
daughters and one precious granddaughter.

Amy Dalton is a faith-rooted scholar-activist who has been an
“observer-participant” in many social justice movements, including Black
Lives Matter and African solidarity organizing, the sanctuary movement
and immigrant advocacy, the global indymedia network, death penalty and
prison abolition, student-labor solidarity, women’s and LGBTQIA
liberation. She is a member of the support team of Proyecto Faro, a
founding member of the Ambazonia Prisoners of Conscience Support
Network, a member of the Community of Living Traditions, and serves on
the board of the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice
(CLBSJ). Amy holds a Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary
with a research focus in faith-based community organizing, and a
Bachelor of Arts with high honors in sociology/anthropology from
Swarthmore College with research focuses in prison history, anthropology
of religion and Marxist social theory. She was raised primarily as a
United Methodist, and has also been influenced by the tradition of
devotion to Mother Mary.
