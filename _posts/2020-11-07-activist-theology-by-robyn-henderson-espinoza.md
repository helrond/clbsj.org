For Dr. Robyn Henderson-Espinoza, "activist theology" is an “invitation
to enter into a movement of becoming that spirals toward justice.” The
author the uses term activist theology “to describe my work of
translating theory to action and theology to practice.

Yet it is more than that. It is a challenge for us to examine our own
theologies in the light of ethics and activism. We are called to “live
our theology out loud.” In reading this book you may find yourself
asking, why isn’t all theology activist theology?

The author is of white and Latinx parentage with white-passing privilege
and a “trans masculine of center Dapper Q* presentation.” I mention this
because of the access to diverse groups and experiences they have that
are detailed in the book and because they indicate how important these
aspects of their identity are in their theoretical work.

Dr. Robyn believes in the power of story -- theirs, ours, others’ and
Jesus’. They weave their story with their premises throughout the book,
as well as asking us to seriously consider our own stories. “Finding the
heart of you own story is the heart of activist theology," they write.
The stories of Jesus are given to us to show that to follow Jesus is to
be an activist theologian. We should emulate his strategies in our activism.

Dr. Robyn gives stories of others as examples of the topics and their
development as a person, scholar and activist.

Dr. Robyn’s theology is “radical political theology” -- a theology that
confronts all of the systemic oppressions of those on the margins. It is
one that midwives more love into the world for a collective liberation.
It is one that uses the way of Jesus as model of radical theology.

To attempt to delineate all of Henderson-Espinoza’s theory of activist
theology would take more space than allotted here. In finishing I would
ultimately say that this is a book well worth reading and having in your
personal library.
