Did you know that, in addition to being a pastor, a scholar, and an
activist, the new President of CLBSJ's Board was once a park ranger?
Rev. Nicholas Johnson worked at Thomas Edison National Historical Park
in West Orange, NJ from 2006-2013. The site was Thomas Edison's home and
workplace for the latter 40 or so years of his life. He gave tours of
the site and created educational programming for both school groups and
general audiences. "It was a really fun time in my prior professional
life," he remembers.

Today Pastor Nick is still focused on helping people understand and
harness power. We asked him to fill us in on several other aspects of
his work and career.

**[Your bio]({{site.baseurl}}/about/leadership/nicholas-a-johnson/) says
that your PhD work at Drew University is focused
on Paul’s epistles, Revelation and the intersections of Africana
postcolonial and new testament studies. What can you tell us about what
questions you are trying to answer?**

I am currently working on my dissertation, “Idolatry in Romans and
Revelation: Toward an Africana-Decolonial Hermeneutic of Images.” It
explores early Christian understandings of idolatry and how statements
against idolatry in biblical texts are racial-ethnic responses to images
and monuments set up by imperial regimes in antiquity. I employ this
reading of idolatry to argue that current movements to dismantle
Confederate statues and other colonial monuments venerating
racial-ethnic hegemony and white supremacy are well situated within the
biblical tradition. Questions that guide my research are: In what ways
are public images and monuments reflective of power dynamics and views
on race, ethnicity, gender, and class? What are the idols in our time
that need to be abandoned for the sake of justice and liberation?

**What has been your own journey as an activist? What issues an
protest formed your political perspective?**

My life in activism began in earnest as an undergrad at the University
of Chicago around issues of race and economic justice. I helped lead an
effort to increase wages and improve working conditions for the
university's dining hall and maintenance works, the vast majority being
people of color. I also was a co-leader in organizing a group of
Chicago-area activists to participate in the March for Justice Rally in
November 2007.

**You are doing some writing now about "the protestor’s Jesus."
What does this mean for activists; for Christology?**

I, along with a friend/colleague, Brian Tipton, are working on a piece
entitled "The Protestors' Jesus: Race, Religion, and Revolution." In it
we explore how Jesus might respond to the shooting deaths of unarmed
black people by police and systemic oppression and injustice within the
U.S. The central claim is that there are stories from the Bible where
Jesus partakes in revolutionary acts to change those institutions meant
to police and enforce order — institutions perceived as oppressive by
the local population. These stories show that there is, in fact, a
Protestors' Jesus.

**In pandemic conditions, what hopes do you have for program and
outreach for CLBSJ?**

My hope for CLBSJ during these unusual times is to take full advantage
of ways to engage scholars, activists, and faith communities digitally.
I have been deeply encouraged by our Scholar-Activist Encounter series.
The success of this series so far lets me know that we can continue to
offer creative and substantive programming and outreach digitally post
pandemic
