## About the participants

**Rev. Abby Mohaupt** began as a Co-Director of Green Seminary Initiative in
the fall of 2016. She is currently a PhD student in Religion, Culture,
and Ecology at Drew Theological School. She previously earned a Master
of Divinity and Master of Theology at McCormick Theological Seminary in
Chicago, IL, with emphases in environmental ministry and eco-feminist
theology. Before returning to the academy, Abby served farm workers and
families in Northern California for four years, where she led cultural
competency, volunteer, environmental education, and children's programs.
She continues to serve the church on the board of the Presbyterian
Hunger Program and Fossil Free PCUSA. She divides her time between
Northern California and New Jersey. Abby is an ordained minister in the
Presbyterian Church (USA).

**Rick Ufford-Chase** and his wife Kitty are the Co-Directors of Stony Point
Conference Center, which houses the primary collections of the CLBSJ.
Rick is also a co-founder of the multifaith Community of Living
Traditions in residence at Stony Point Center, a community of twenty
Christians, Muslims and Jews is dedicated to the study and practice of
nonviolence, peace, and social and eco justice. Rick worked in the
sanctuary movement for Central American refugees in the 1980's and
co-founded BorderLinks, Samaritans and No More Deaths over the following
twenty years to respond directly to the crisis in the borderlands. He
and his wife Kitty also co-founded Maya Quetzal Restaurant and the
Sitting Tree Community in Tucson. There is a reason the word "co-" lives
in front of most everything he does: Rick believes in collaboration and
the power of community. He is a lay preacher, and is the author of
_Faithful Resistance: Gospel Visions for the Church in a Time of Empire_
(2016).
