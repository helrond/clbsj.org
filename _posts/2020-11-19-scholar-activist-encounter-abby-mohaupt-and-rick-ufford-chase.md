## About the participants

**abby mohaupt** lives on a farm in Texas. A native of Northern Illinois,
she's an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church (USA). abby served
urban, suburban, and rural congregations and communities before starting
a PhD at Drew University in Religion, Culture, and Ecology. She serves
on the boards of enfleshed, CreatureKind, and Presbyterian Peace
Fellowship. She is likely to be found with coffee in her hand and a
chicken on her lap.

**Rick Ufford-Chase** is a founding board member of the CLBSJ and the
Co-Director of Stony Point Center with his wife Kitty. Though himself a
self-described "seminary drop-out," Rick has had a lifelong fascination
with scriptural exegesis and theological inquiry. Rick has been deeply
involved in movements for immigration advocacy and systemic economic
change, though his recent interests have dealt more specifically with
the case for reparations for Native Americans and African Americans.
Rick is an outdoorsman, happiest when he is in a canoe on a quiet lake
at sunrise. He is the author of _Faithful Resistance: Gospel Visions for
the Church in a Time of Empire_.
