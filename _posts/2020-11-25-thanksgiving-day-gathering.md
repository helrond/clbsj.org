The Sweetwater Cultural Center, an indigenous people’s embassy that
opened its doors just down the street from CLBSJ earlier this fall, is
hosting an online gathering of talks, stories, ceremony and music at 2pm
Eastern Time this Thursday, November 25.

Sweetwater was born out of an act of grassroots reparations between the
Hudson River Presbytery and the Ramapough Lenape Nation. CLBSJ Board
Treasurer Rick Ufford-Chase played a central role in inspiring and
facilitating this process. Below is his invitation for all to join in
this "Celebration With an Attitude of Gratitude":

<blockquote>
I am writing to share with you about a wonderful opportunity tomorrow
(Thanksgiving Day). Many of you know that for many years Kitty and I
have been hosting a potluck Thanksgiving for those who don't have
anywhere to go. A few years ago, we were approached by our good friend
Evan Pritchard about the possibility of transforming that event into an
opportunity for reflection about the real history of the encounter
between European settlers and indigenous peoples of Turtle Island. Over
the last three years, this has turned into a remarkable day of wisdom
sharing, stories, music, laughter and fellowship.<br/><br/>

This year, Sweetwater Cultural Center is co-hosting the event with Evan
by zoom. Gretchen Brokaw and I (both of us members of the Sweetwater
Board) will be in the background handling tech, timing and other
logistics. As you will see in the attached flyer, we are calling this
year's event "Indigenous Elders Wisdom Sharing: A Celebration with an
Attitude of Gratitude."<br/><br/>

Kitty and I intend to hunker down in our cabin for a pandemic
thanksgiving meal, even though we have family just a short distance away
through the woods, and then to join all of you for this moment to
reflect together on all that we have to be grateful for even in the
midst of a year in which so many have experienced such tremendous loss.<br/><br/>

There is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/Indigenous-Elders-Wisdom-Sharing-2020.pdf">a flyer attached</a> that you are welcome to share with others. I
have also provided the zoom invite directly below in this email to make
it easier for you to join us. The event will start at 2 pm eastern time
and end sometime around 4 pm. You are welcome to come and go around your
familiy celebrations as necessary.<br/><br/>

Blessings during this strange time,<br/>
Rick<br/><br/>
