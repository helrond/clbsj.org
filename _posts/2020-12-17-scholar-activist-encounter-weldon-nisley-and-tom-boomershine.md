In this session, lifelong peace activist Weldon Nisly and biblical
scholar Tom Boomershine will discuss their commitment to understand and
respond to the Gospel’s call to peacemaking — within the academy, within
Christian community, and in conflict zones around the world. They will
focus on the struggle of the Kurds in Northern Iraq targeted by Turkey's
military in the context of the Iraq war, as well as the Palestinian
struggle in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. This event is co-sponsored by the
[Christian Peacemaker Teams](https://www.cpt.org/), who have teams in Iraqi
Kurdistan and Palestine, and the
[Network of Biblical Storytellers International](https://www.nbsint.org/).

Advance registration is required.

## About the participants

**Weldon Nisly** served four decades in Mennonite pastoral and peace ministry
in Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and Seattle until retiring in late 2013. He now
engages in prayerful listening active nonviolent presence for peace locally and
globally. He participated on peace delegations in Nicaragua (1984, 1990) and Russia (1988).
He served with [Christian Peacemaker Teams](http://www.cpt.org) delegations in Iraq (2003, 2010, 2014)
and half-time on the Iraqi Kurdistan and Palestine teams from 2017 to
the present. Prior to ministry, he was a political organizer in Iowa
(1968-73) where he grew up on a farm. Weldon earned a BBA in economics
and political science at the University of Iowa (1966-72) and an MA in
Peace Studies at Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary (1995-97),
writing his master’s thesis on Liberation Theology after studying in
Colombia (1977). He is a lifelong Mennonite and a Benedictine Oblate
since 2001, affiliated with Saint John’s Abbey in Collegeville, MN,
where he was a Resident Scholar at the Collegeville Institute (2001,
2007, 2010, 2015). Weldon writes and speaks on war and peace calling for
a paradigm shift from Just War to Just Peace. His published articles
include: “Victims of War are Not Our Enemies” (_Seattle Times_, _The
Mennonite_, and _CommonDreams_ (2003), “To Guide Our Feet: Pastoral Action
in Impossible Times” (in _Stumbling Toward a Genuine Conversation on
Homosexuality_, edited by Michael King, 2007); “From Silence to Salaam: A
Reflection on Contemplative Peacebuilding” (_The Oblate_, June 2015), and
“Pandemic and Peace: Healthcare Not Warfare” (_Hospitality_, July and
September 2020).

**Thomas E. Boomershine** (PhD, Union Theological Seminary) is an emeritus
professor of New Testament and a United Methodist elder. He has been an
activist as a biblical storyteller, educator (New York and United
Theological Seminaries), author, and community organizer of the Network
of Biblical Storytellers, International, and the Bible in Ancient and
Modern Media research group in SBL. His detailed studies of the Gospels
as ancient storytelling across the boundaries of the cultures of Israel
and the Gentile Greco-Roman world are a foundation for peacemaking in
the modern world. His research and advocacy have also helped to initiate
the development of performance criticism as a methodology for biblical
study. His books, _Story Journey: An Introduction to the Gospel as
Storytelling_ (1988) and _The Messiah of Peace_ (2015), are resources for
the reconception of the Gospels as stories of peacemaking and of
biblical storytelling as a strategy for non-violent resistance to
violence and warfare. He has published numerous books and articles,
including _The Messiah of Peace: A Performance-Criticism Commentary on
Mark’s Passion-Resurrection Narrative_ (2015) and _Story Journey: An
Invitation to the Gospel as Storytelling_ (1988).
