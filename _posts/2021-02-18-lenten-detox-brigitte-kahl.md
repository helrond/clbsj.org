**Brigitte Kahl** is an innovative New Testament scholar whose work focuses
on analyzing the dynamic relationship between the New Testament and the
Roman Empire. In her pioneering book, _Galatians Re-Imagined: Reading
with the Eyes of the Vanquished_ (2010), Dr. Kahl re-defines the
traditional paradigm of Pauline interpretation and radically recasts
justification by faith as a theology of resistance and transformation. A
native of East Germany and an ordained minister, Dr. Kahl studied and
taught at Humboldt University in Berlin between 1970 and 1997, earning
two doctorates in New Testament and Ecumenics (1983/86). Her first major
publication in German (1986) dealt with the theological and political
dialectics of the Gospel for the Poor and the Gospel for the Gentiles in
Luke-Acts. Read her full bio here: [https://utsnyc.edu/faculty/brigitte-kahl/](https://utsnyc.edu/faculty/brigitte-kahl/)
