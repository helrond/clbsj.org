In this session, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, OLC, will lead us in an
experience-based exploration of John 3:14-21, which appears in the
lectionary this week, and related texts. Drawing from her engagement
with the Buddhist practice of visualization, we will explore how
focusing on our personal experiences with the Divine can help to unlock
the meaning of this text.
