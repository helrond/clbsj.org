title: 'Study of Mark 12:13-17 led by Dong Hyeon Jeong'
description: >-
  In this session, Rev. Dr. Dong Hyeon Jeong will present an alternative
  reading of Mark 12:13-17, in which Jesus discusses taxation with the
  Pharisees and Herodians. This passage contains the instruction to
  "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things
  that are God's," which has often been used to imply the need for blind
  acceptance of authority.
