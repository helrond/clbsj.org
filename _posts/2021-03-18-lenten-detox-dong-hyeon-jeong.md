description: >-
  In this session, Rev. Dr. Dong Hyeon Jeong will present an alternative reading
  of Mark 12:13-17, in which Jesus discusses taxation with the Pharisees and
  Herodians. This passage contains the instruction to "Render to Caesar the
  things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's," which has
