Our final session will be held on Maundy Thursday and led by Dr. Crystal L. Hall, Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies at United Lutheran Seminary. Crystal will focus on Philippians 2:5-11, which is in the lectionary for this week and contains the "Christ Hymn", thought to be one the earliest devotional liturgies of the emerging church. Using empire criticism and reading the Bible with the poor methodologies, she will help us dig deeper into the question of who Jesus is and where he shows up in antiquity and today.
