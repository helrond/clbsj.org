---

Calling all Bible-o-Philes! Please join us on Thursday April 15, 7:30pm
Eastern Time, to help shape CLBSJâ€™s emerging approach to biblical
engagement.

If you participated in any way in the Lenten Bible Detox, either live or
via recording, we cordially invite you to participate in an open debrief
and visioning session. We will have a structured meta-cognitive
conversation about our experience with the Bible Detox series, how we
generally engage with and learn about the Bible and social justice, and
how we can work together to create more empowering forums for biblical
engagement among scholars, activists, artists and faith leaders.
