  Socialism Working Group of the Democratic Socialists of America invite you to
  a special Scholar-Activist Encounter featuring Rabbi Michael Feinberg and Dr.
  Norman Gottwald.  The focus of the discussion will be the continuing relevance
  of Dr. Gottwald’s 1979 book Tribes of Yahweh: A Sociology of the Religion of
  Liberated Israel, 1250-1050 BCE. We will present an overview of its central
  thesis regarding political and socioloigcal dynamics surrounding the emergence
  of the Jewish people, including his nontraditional reading of the slaughter of
  the Canaanites. We will then discuss how Dr. Gottwald’s thesis influenced
  activists like Rabbi Feinberg, how his thinking has evolved since it’s
  publication, and how these ideas are relevant for multifaith movement-building
  today.
