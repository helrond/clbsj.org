In honor of "Black August," CLBSJ is embarking on a deep dive into the transformative and revolutionary aspects of Black religion.  We will convene each Tuesday during August at at 4:30 Pacific Time / 7:30 Eastern Time via Zoom to explore the theme: "Why Black Religion Matters: remembering and centering Black/Africana contributions to our scriptural traditions."

“Black August” is a pan-African and internationalist tradition that recognizes the month of August as a living testament of the depth of commitment to transformation and liberation within Black communities around the world. From the beginning of the Haitian Revolution to the Nat Turner Rebellion; from the Fugitive Slave Law Convention and the foundation of the Underground Railroad to the March on Washington; from the uprising in Watts (1965) to the Uprising in Ferguson (2013); from the births of Marcus Garvey, Russell Maroon Shoatz, and Fred Hampton to the deaths of Emmett Till, W.E.B du Bois and Michael Brown — August bursts at the seams with histories of Black resistance. Because of this, organizers have claimed it as a month to deepen understanding of and commitment to the practices that lead us to liberation. CLBSJ is honored to join this tradition.
