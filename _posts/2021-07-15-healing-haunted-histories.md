## About the Book
Part memoir; part social, historical, and theological analysis; and part
practical workbook, _Healing Haunted Histories_ invites settler Christians
(and other people of faith) into a discipleship of decolonization. How
are our histories, landscapes, and communities haunted by continuing
Indigenous dispossession? How do we transform our colonizing
self-perceptions, lifeways, and structures? And how might we practice
restorative solidarity with Indigenous communities today? The authors
write as, and for, settlers on this journey, looking at issues of
Indigenous justice and settler “response-ability” through the lens of
Elaine’s Mennonite family narrative, from Ukrainian steppes to Canadian
prairies to California chaparral. They examine her forebearers’
immigrant travails and trauma, settler unknowing and complicity, and
traditions of resilience and conscience. And they invite readers to do
the same. Read more:
