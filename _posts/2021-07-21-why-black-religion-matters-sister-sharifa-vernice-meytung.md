**Sister Sharifa writes:**

_Forces of popular education, industrial and urban growth, and mass communications have changed the way in which many communities record, remember and pass along their stories. To experience the oral narratives of a community, within their cultural and spiritual context, is to benefit from the movement of the Spirit as She guides and shapes and teaches._

_Tales expand the horizons of our minds, all the while challenging us to remain firmly rooted like the baobab tree...or the olive tree...or the bodhi tree. Rooted in a noble, shared truth. Namely, that all our stories matter and are worth remembering and retelling. To remember our roots in this way, is to remember why all creatures (even Br’er Rabbit) cherish freedom._

_African cosmogonies, Buddhism, Christianity, and Judaism all have stories to tell. These stories creatively teach and challenge practitioners in both the coarse and subtle aspects of their faiths and traditions. To experience parallel examples of the continental and diasporan African tales; alongside the Jataka tales of early Buddhism; in step with Christian and Jewish parables, is to throw open the window and breathe in The Word... All the words. Ultimately, one hopes to be moved to record and retell a few words of liberation, of one’s own._
