**Dr. Lisa M. Bowens** is associate professor of New Testament at Princeton Theological Seminary. Her newest book, African American Readings of Paul: Reception, Resistance, and Transformation (Eerdmans), is the first book devoted solely to investigating a historical trajectory of how African Americans have understood Paul and utilized his work to resist and protest injustice and racism in their own writings from the 1700s to the mid-twentieth century. She is also the author of _An Apostle in Battle: Paul and Spiritual Warfare in 2 Corinthians 12:1-10_ (2017). Her research interests include Paul and apocalyptic literature, Pauline anthropology, Pauline epistemology, aspects of discipleship in the gospels, African American Pauline Hermeneutics, and New Testament exegesis and interpretation. She participates in many collaborative scholarly initiatives, including as editor of the Oxford Online Bible and Race Project and as a member of the Steering Committee for the African American Biblical Hermeneutics Group (SBL).
