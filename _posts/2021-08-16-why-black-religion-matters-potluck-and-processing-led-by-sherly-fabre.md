All are invited to come together to "digest" the perspectives that have been shared during CLBSJ's inaugural Black August series, to share additional insights, and to discuss how to build on it going forward. 

What is the relevance of our religious practices to carrying forward the tradition of Black August? What have we learned; what questions have been raised? Please bring whatever thoughts and insights you have been cooking up!

Series host Sherly Fabre will offer reflections on Black August that come from her Haitian heritage and her Muslim faith practice.

As has been our tradition, we will open with a libation ceremony honoring inviting the living memory of our ancestors into the room. All are invited to bring names to contribute to this ceremony.
