title: Muslim Peace Fellowship Donates Library to CLBSJ
---
We are elated that the Muslim Peace Fellowship has donated their collection of scholarly and devotional titles to CLBSJ! The collection has been assembled by three scholars — Nejat Aydin, Michael Strong and Rabia Harris — and includes a broad spectrum of books representing many points of view. 

As with the rest of our titles, the collection is available for use by scholars, seekers and activists from all walks of life, regardless of institutional or religious affiliation. Because we want our materials to be available at any time for research, we do not lend out books. 

You can view the new collection virtually at [librarything.com](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/MPFellowship). At this time, the physical library collection can be accessed by appointment. Please call 845-603-2508 or email info@clbsj.org to schedule your visit.
