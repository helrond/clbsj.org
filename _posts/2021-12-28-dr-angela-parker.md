CLBSJ is honored to welcome Dr. Angela Parker to discuss her recently-published book, [If God Still Breathes, Why Can't I? Black Lives Matter and Biblical Authority](https://www.amazon.com/God-Still-Breathes-Why-Cant/dp/0802879268). In this book, Dr. Parker uses womanist biblical interpretation to take on the conflation of biblical authority with the doctrines of inerrancy and infallibility. Our discussion will focus on how the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired the ideas in this book, and inpacted the realm of Biblical Studies generally.

She received her B.A. in religion and philosophy from Shaw University (2008), her M.T.S. from Duke Divinity School (2008-2010) and her Ph.D. in Bible, culture, and hermeneutics (New Testament focus) from Chicago Theological Seminary (2015). Before this position, Dr. Parker was assistant professor of Biblical Studies at The Seattle School of Theology & Psychology for four years.
