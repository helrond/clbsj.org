CLBSJ is honored to welcome Dr. Angela N. Parker and Dr. Karri L. Whipple to discuss Dr. Parker's recently-published book, _[If God Still Breathes, Why Can't I? Black Lives Matter and Biblical Authority](https://www.amazon.com/God-Still-Breathes-Why-Cant/dp/0802879268)_. In this book, Dr. Parker uses womanist biblical interpretation to take on the conflation of biblical authority with the doctrines of inerrancy and infallibility. Our discussion will focus on how the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired the ideas in this book, and impacted the realm of Biblical Studies generally.

**Dr. Karri L. Whipple** is the Faculty Fellow of Global Works and Society at New York University. She received her PhD in New Testament with a focus in Women's and Gender Studies from Drew University. Her research focuses on the intersection of trauma, identity, and biblical interpretation. In particular, Dr. Whipple examines the impacts of biblical texts in perpetuating and addressing racially-, gender- and sexuality-based traumas. Her teaching focuses on topics of queer hermeneutics, domination and resistance in antiquity, inclusive pedogocial practices, trauma and sacred texts, and womanist/feminist hermeneutics. She also works with grassroots organizations and with NGOs at the United Nations to advocate for gender equity, media rights, and intimate justice.
