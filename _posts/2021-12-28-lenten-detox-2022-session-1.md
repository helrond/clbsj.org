title: 'Study of 1 Timothy 2:8-15 led by Crystal Hall'
series: lenten-detox
---
In this session, Dr. Crystal Hall will reread 1 Timothy 2:8-15, a passage perhaps more than any other used to silence women and deny women's leadership. She'll contextualize this passage within its socio-historical context, in which there was increasing pressure on the early church to accommodate to Greco-Roman gender norms.
