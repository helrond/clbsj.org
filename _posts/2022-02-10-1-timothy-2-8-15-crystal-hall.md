In this session, Dr. Crystal Hall will reread [1 Timothy 2:8-15](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=510380030), a passage perhaps more than any other used to silence women and deny women's leadership. She'll contextualize this passage within its socio-historical context, in which there was increasing pressure on the early church to accommodate to Greco-Roman gender norms.

**Dr. Crystal L. Hall** is a community organizer, political educator and the Kraft Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies at United Lutheran Seminary in Pennsylvania. She has taught at United Lutheran Seminary since 2018, and co-directs the Guatemala Immersion Semester Program. Her research and teaching address God’s call into right relationship with the human Other and with Earth. Her research focuses on the Pauline corpus, apocalyptic literature, poverty and wealth, and ecological and liberationist hermeneutics. Her methodological commitments include empire criticism and feminist theory. Her teaching privileges voices historically excluded from the classroom and the Church. She is a frequent speaker in congregational and synodical settings on women’s leadership, LGBTQIA+ inclusion, and immigration. Before coming to ULS, Dr. Hall worked as a community organizer and political educator with organizations advocating for human rights, environmental justice and ending poverty. She served on staff with the Poverty Initiative (now the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights and Social Justice), United Workers and the Sierra Club.
