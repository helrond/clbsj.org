**Dr. Luis Menéndez–Antuña** is Assistant Professor of New Testament at Boston University School of Theology. He is interested in liberation theologies, cultural studies, and critical theory. His current research explores the queer and postcolonial afterlives of the biblical texts, and he has published his research on journals such as Estudios Eclesiásticos, Ilu. Revista de Ciencias de las Religiones, Biblical Interpretation, Journal of Religious Ethics, Early Christianity, Critical Research on Religion, Journal of Biblical Literature, and the Journal of the American Academy of Religion.  His first monograph on Revelation, _Thinking Sex with the Great Whore: Deviant Sexualities and Empire in the Book of Revelation_ (Routledge) offers an emancipatory reading of Revelation 17-18 using postcolonial and queer historiographies to explore emancipatory paths for identity formation in Biblical texts. Menéndez-Antuña also brings twelve years of activism and ministry experience. He has worked in community organizing, HIV advocacy, homeless shelters, prison, and with kids on the street. His political and theological commitments spring from his involvement in Catholic Christian Base Communities rooted in Latin-American Liberation Theology.
