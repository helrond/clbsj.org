title: 'Study of Mark 15:1-15 led by Tom Boomershine and Joyce Bressler'
time: '7:30 PM Eastern Time'
series: lenten-detox
---
In this session, Dr. Tom Boomershine will explore the accounts of Jesus' appearance before Pontius Pilate, governor of the province of Judaea under the Roman Empire. Dr. Boomershine will challenge the way this text has been interpreted to justify and perpetuate antisemitism, and propose how a rigorously contextual reading exposes this perspective to be unjustifiable. Joyce Bressler, co-chair of the Community of Living Traditions and longtime peace activist, will give perspective based on her experience in multifaith organizing.

This study will focus on [Mark's account](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=511340094), but will also touch on the versions of the story that appear in the other gospels.

**Rev. Dr. Thomas E. Boomershine** (PhD, Union Theological Seminary) is an emeritus professor of New Testament, a United Methodist elder, and a Board member of the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice. He has been an activist as a biblical storyteller, educator (New York and United Theological Seminaries), author, and community organizer of the Network of Biblical Storytellers, International, and the Bible in Ancient and Modern Media research group in SBL. His detailed studies of the Gospels as ancient storytelling across the boundaries of the cultures of Israel and the Gentile Greco-Roman world are a foundation for peacemaking in the modern world. His research and advocacy have also helped to initiate the development of performance criticism as a methodology for biblical study. His books, _Story Journey: An Introduction to the Gospel as Storytelling_ (1988) and _The Messiah of Peace_ (2015), are resources for the reconception of the Gospels as stories of peacemaking and of biblical storytelling as a strategy for non-violent resistance to violence and warfare.
