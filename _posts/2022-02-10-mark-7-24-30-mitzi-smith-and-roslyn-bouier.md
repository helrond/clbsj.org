In this session, Dr. Mitzi J. Smith will explore Jesus' encounter with the Syrophoenician Woman as it is rendered in the gospel of [Mark 7:24-30](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=512381860). In this controversial story, Jesus appears to deliver a ethnic insult. In conversation with community activist Rev. Roslyn Murray Bouier, Dr. Smith will unpack the socio-political context in which this conversation took place, and suggest a re-reading of the text that centers the agency of the woman.
