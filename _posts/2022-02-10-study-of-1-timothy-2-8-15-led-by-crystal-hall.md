In this session, Dr. Crystal Hall will reread [1 Timothy 2:8-15](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=510380030), a passage perhaps more than any other used to silence women and deny women's leadership. She'll contextualize this passage within its socio-historical context, in which there was increasing pressure on the early church to accommodate to Greco-Roman gender norms.
