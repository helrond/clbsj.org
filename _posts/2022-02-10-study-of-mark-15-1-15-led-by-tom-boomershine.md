title: 'Study of Mark 15:1-15 led by Tom Boomershine '
time: '7:30 PM Eastern Time'
series: lenten-detox

In this session, Dr. Tom Boomershine will explore the accounts of Jesus' appearance before Pontius Pilate, governor of the province of Judaea under the Roman Empire. Dr. Boomershine will challenge the way this text has been interpreted to justify and perpetuate antisemitism, and propose how a rigorously contextual reading exposes this perspective to be unjustifiable.

This study will focus on [Mark's account](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=511340094), but will also touch on the versions of the story that appear in the other gospels.
