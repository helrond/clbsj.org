In this session, Dr. Chris Hoklotubbe and Kimberlee Medicine Horn will delve into Matthew 28:16-20, otherwise known as “the Great Commission,” unpacking how it has been used to drive settler colonialism and justify the cultural genocide of Indigenous culture. They will explore the context of this passage and consider how it has been interpreted over time, focusing in particular on how its theological legacy justified Indigenous Boarding Schools.

Dr. Hoklotubbe will further consider how other stories of Scripture represent missed opportunities for imagining how to engage with other cultures, and Medicine Horn will share with us her work with a national research team tasked with investigating the dark history of indigenous boarding schools.
