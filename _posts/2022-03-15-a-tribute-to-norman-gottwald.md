Dear friends, we are so very sorry to share that pioneering Hebrew Bible scholar
and CLBSJ co-founder Norman Gottwald passed away on Friday, March 11, 2022.
Norman is best known for applying socio-historical methods to unpack the class
context of the emergence of ancient Israel. He has been deeply involved in anti-war
and social justice organizing since the 1960s. His persistent, proactive efforts
to make biblical scholarship relevant in the struggle, and vice versa, forms the
visionary substrate for CLBSJ.

Our deepest condolences go out to Laura and his whole family. We expect that
information on a remotely accessible memorial service will be made available soon.
