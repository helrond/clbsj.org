Dear friends, we are so very sorry to share that pioneering Hebrew Bible scholar and CLBSJ co-founder Norman Gottwald passed away on Friday, March 11, 2022. Norman is best known for applying socio-historical methods to unpack the class context of the emergence of ancient Israel. He has been deeply involved in anti-war and social justice organizing since the 1960s. His persistent, proactive efforts to make biblical scholarship relevant in the struggle, and vice versa, forms the visionary substrate for CLBSJ.

Our deepest condolences go out to Laura and his whole family. We expect that information on a remotely accessible memorial service will be made available soon.

Norman was a friend, mentor and inspiration to so many. If Norman touched your life, we invite you to send a tribute to [clbsjorg@gmail.com](mail to:clbsjorg@gmail.com). We will compile and publish these tributes here. We will also use this page to gather audio-visual archives of Norman's scholarship and teaching. If you have any to share, please send these as well!

## Tributes:

### From Rev. Laurel Dykstra:
Norman Gottwald was a brilliant man with a powerful love of justice who lived a long life. I am incredibly grateful for the way that his biblical scholarship changed the way that I and many of us read Hebrew Scriptures, but I am equally grateful for the glimpses of the real person that I got to experience through Word and World Schools and the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice: Norm and colleagues learning to navigate reply all on emails. Norm walking students through the book-packed guest room that was his home library, gesturing to a wall of shelves and shrugging, “these shelves are my publications.” Norm showing off Laura’s quilts. Feminist colleagues (of various ideologies) challenging my selections our Top 100 Books on the Bible and Justice list, when they were in fact Norm’s. An earnest and unasked-for explanation of how the tall masked man caught on film flipping a (police?) car during the Berkeley Free Speech Movement actions could not have been him. Norm’s giraffe-like pirouette from the chorus of a liturgical dance interpretation of the woman who anointed Jesus. Norm compiling a list of prophets who resist modern empires. Safe home Norm, may you rest in peace and rise in power.
