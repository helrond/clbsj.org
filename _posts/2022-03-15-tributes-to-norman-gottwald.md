Dear friends, 
CLBSJ is so very sorry to share that pioneering Hebrew Bible scholar and CLBSJ co-founder Norman Gottwald passed away on Friday, March 11, 2022. A Baptist minister, husband and father, Norman is best known for applying socio-historical methods to unpack the class context of the emergence of ancient Israel. He has been deeply involved in anti-war and social justice organizing since the 1960s. His persistent, proactive efforts to make biblical scholarship relevant for social justice organizing, and vice versa, forms the visionary substrate for CLBSJ.

Our deepest condolences go out to Laura and his whole family. We expect that information on a remotely accessible memorial service will be made available soon.

Norman was a friend, mentor and inspiration to so many. If Norman touched your life, we invite you to send a tribute to [clbsjorg@gmail.com](mail to:clbsjorg@gmail.com). We will compile and publish these tributes here. We will also use this page to gather audio-visual archives of Norman's scholarship and teaching. If you have any to share, please send these as well!

## Tributes:

### From Rev. Laurel Dykstra:
Norman Gottwald was a brilliant man with a powerful love of justice who lived a long life. I am incredibly grateful for the way that his biblical scholarship changed the way that I and many of us read Hebrew Scriptures, but I am equally grateful for the glimpses of the real person that I got to experience through Word and World Schools and the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice: Norm and colleagues learning to navigate reply all on emails. Norm walking students through the book-packed guest room that was his home library, gesturing to a wall of shelves and shrugging, “these shelves are my publications.” Norm showing off Laura’s quilts. Feminist colleagues (of various ideologies) challenging my selections our Top 100 Books on the Bible and Justice list, when they were in fact Norm’s. An earnest and unasked-for explanation of how the tall masked man caught on film flipping a (police?) car during the Berkeley Free Speech Movement actions could not have been him. Norm’s giraffe-like pirouette from the chorus of a liturgical dance interpretation of the woman who anointed Jesus. Norm compiling a list of prophets who resist modern empires. Safe home Norm, may you rest in peace and rise in power. 

### From Ludwig Beethoven J. Noya:
Encountering Prof. Gottwald’s work on social class in my intro class to Hebrew Bible is like finding a treasure. Prof. Gottwald provided me with a language to a concept that I’ve been suspicious of for a long time but have no language to express or talk about. Indeed, the social class analysis in the Hebrew Bible could not be separated from Prof. Gottwald’s name.

Since December, I have collaborated with Prof. Matthew Coomber in planning a panel to commemorate Prof. Gottwald’s 30 years of Presidential Class at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in Denver, CO. Several respected scholars have been invited and have confirmed their participation, with the hope of Prof. Gottwald’s presence as well. The panelists are looking forward to the panel to celebrate a scholar whose work and kind personality have been an inspiration.

The panel, however, will certainly be different without Prof. Gottwald’s presence. But I believe his ethos, courage, and a strong commitment to social justice will surely present. May his memory be a blessing.  

### From R. Douglas Bendall:
My first acquaintance with Norman was when I took the O.T. class at E.T.S.S.W. Seminary in Austin. We used Norman's text  A Light to the Nations as the main textbook. There was another well-known text suggested as well. However, class members recognized Norman's text to be far better than the alternative and asked that Norman's be the only one used. The request was accepted.

I still remember reading the preface to Norman's book. He spoke of the fact that however one reads the O.T., it is "profoundly conceived". That core idea has remained in my mind ever since.

Following my disastrous first year of parish ministry, when I came to experience the institutional Church as very different from what I expected, I made the decision to return to graduate school to rethink my faith and commitment to the Church. When I learned that Norman was at the GTU, I decided to study in Berkeley. At the time, Dr. John Knox was my mentor. I visited John at his home and spoke with him about my choice of graduate schools. I told John I wanted to study with Norman, but my area of specialization was to be Process Theology. My issue was that I had no idea if the GTU had a Process theologian. John said (I can still hear his voice), "Why don't you just go to Berkeley; you will find someone there." I took John's advice and learned when I arrived with my family that Bernie Loomer, who is credited with naming the field of Process Theology, was there.

Among my first classes was a seminar with Norman who had just returned from a year in Israel to do research on what became The Tribes of Yahweh. Thus, I was in the first class that was blessed to hear Norman's ideas on the origins of Ancient Israel. During the course of the semester, I noticed that Norman was using his research notes as the basis for his lectures.

As you may recall, Norman was quite politically engaged in political protests in Berkeley at the time. I became involved also. Norman came up with the idea of creating a news publication on political activism in Berkeley. He suggested naming it "The Threefold Cord" from a text in Proverbs. We offered [for free] copies of  occasional issues for a few years to students and anyone else who was interested in what we had to say. I recall making the suggestion that theological education needs to be re-conceived. Norman agreed and together we formed the Alternative Seminary Caucus at the GTU and invited seminary and graduate students to join us. Charles McCoy at PSR also joined us as a valued member of the faculty and our organization. We worked on this project for 3 or 4 years. My special role was to develop the curriculum for the new alternative seminary we envisioned.

After receiving my doctorate at the GTU, I carried the vision of the Alternative Seminary in my mind from 1977 to 1995 when the Lord called me to "begin the school." I was called to found The Newark School of Theology in Newark, NJ. Norman gave the main inaugural address at its opening convocation in September 1997.

Over the years Norman was a teacher, "fellow traveler", mentor, colleague, and friend. He has played a most important role in the course of my life. But, of course, more than anything Norman has played a leading role in the recovery of the political significance of Ancient Israel for the development of a Global Civilization.

I remember how it was that Norman lost his tenured position at the Berkeley Baptist Seminary because of his 'controversial' theology and political activism. Norman paid dearly for his commitment both to scholarly integrity and his politics. Fortunately, he found a good home and academic position at NYTS.

Norman has been my model for intellectual and scholarly integrity for my whole career as a teacher, inner-city minister, and theological educator. He was one of the best thinkers I have ever known. Among his many gifts, I value most his gifts as a historian. I know of no one, apart from Dr. John Knox, who equals Norman in the quality of his historical scholarship.

Above all, Norman was a good friend. But he was also my leading example of a person of courage and integrity. I shall always remember him and honor his memory. The world is the better for his life, his work, and his example of a life well-lived.

Amy said in her announcement that she visited Norman and Laura in Berkeley shortly before Norman's passing. She mentioned that Norman was planning to write a book on the prophets. It seems to me--and I believe--Norman has by his life, courage, and love entered into Eternal Life with Christ. I imagine him conversing with the Hebrew prophets
whom he studied and wrote about in his lifetime in this world.
