CLBSJ is pleased to again join forces with the Alternative Seminary to host a teaching and discussion on [Luke 16:1-13](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=522052784), the Parable of the Manager of Unjust Wealth. CLBSJ Board Member Rev. Dr. Dong Hyeon Jeong summarizes his resistance reading of this confounding parable, drawing from socio-economic analysis of the biblical context, his experience as a Korean missionary in the Phillippines, as well as Mel Chen’s Animacies Theory.

This event is a part of the Alternative Seminary’s course, "Challenging Power and Privilege: A ten-week online study of the Gospel of Luke." Members of the class cohort provide responses to Dr. Jeong's teaching.
