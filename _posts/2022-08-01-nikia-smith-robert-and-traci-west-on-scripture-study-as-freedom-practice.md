Rev. Dr. Nikia Smith Robert and Dr. Traci West will share about how engagement with scripture aids in efforts to dismantle and heal from the far-reaching effects of the system of racialized overpolicing and mass incarceration. Dr. Robert will share about the work she has done to train Black churches to become "Abolition Sanctuaries" that embody emancipatory theology and enact abolitionist principles to repair, restore, and rebuild society, and the scriptures that she draws from the most in this work. Dr. West will share about her experience teaching toward deep healing and restoration within prisons, and particularly the teaching of Musa Dube's "Fifty Years of Bleeding" in a men's prison.
