To close our series, Dr. Charlene Sinclair will take us on a deep dive into an essay by W.E.B. DuBois which is addressed in the final chapter of James Cone’s _The Cross and the Lynching Tree_. DuBois, whose historical and sociological work has been deeply formative in the Abolition Democracy organizing tradition, wrote “Jesus Christ in Texas” as part of a collection of autobiographical essays, poems and short stories published in 1920 under the title _Darkwater: Voices from within the Veil._ Dr. Sinclair will draw from her doctoral dissertation in which she examined the work of James Cone, including the often overlooked relationship between his analysis and WEB DuBois’ work.

Charlene serves as a consultant, trainer, and adviser to leading social change organizations and individual prophetic leaders, and she is the Chief of Staff for Race Forward. Strongly influenced by the pathbreaking thought of the late James Cone, Dr. Sinclair helps to fashion strategies that embrace a liberationist approach to faith and spirituality in the context of popular struggles for racial and economic justice.
