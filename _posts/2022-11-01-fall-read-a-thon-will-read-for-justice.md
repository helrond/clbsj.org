_**Calling all Friends of CLBSJ!**_ We have amazingly been challenged by a donor to raise $25,000 before the end of the year. To help us meet this goal and have fun doing it, we are "coming out" as hopeless bibliophiles and embarking on a Fall Read-a-Thon! Together, Board members and friends of CLBSJÂ have committed to read at least 5,000 pages.

**Can you help us reach our goal by donating to support the read-a-thon?** You can make a per-page pledge for your favorite reader, or you can make a flat donation to the entire campaign. Check out details and make your gift at RallyUp.com.

Please also take this opportunity to share this campaign with folks in your networks who might not yet be connected to CLBSJ, but share our passion for linking the Bible and social justice! Our readers will be posting "mini-reviews" of what we read, making this project a great opportunity to get to know CLBSJ and our commitments. Check out some of the books we are reading below...
