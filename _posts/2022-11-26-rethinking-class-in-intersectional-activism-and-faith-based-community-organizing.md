_Continuing Critical Reflections on the Work of Norman K. Gottwald_

This online seminar will continue discussions begun at the annual meeting of the Society for Biblical Literature in November 2022 on the effects that Dr. Norman Gottwald's presidential address given at SBL 30 years ago, [Social Class as an Analytic and Hermeneutical Category in Biblical Studies](https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/presidentialaddresses/JBL112_1_1Gottwald1992.pdf), has had on the role of class analysis in Biblical studies. The gathering will consist of seven prepared remarks (speakers noted below), interspersed by facilitated small group discussion. 

The session is organized by the [Wendland-Cook Program in Religion and Justice](https://www.religionandjustice.org/) at Vanderbilt Divinity School and the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice.
