**_Continuing Reflections on the Work of Norman K. Gottwald_**

Dear friends,

CLBSJ and the [Wendland-Cook Program in Religion and Justice](https://www.religionandjustice.org/) are very pleased to invite you to a special online seminar to honor and continue to reflect on the scholarly legacy of CLBSJ's co-founder, Rev. Dr. Norman K. Gottwald. The event will be held on the one year anniversary of Dr. Gottwald's passing, March 11.

This online seminar will continue discussions begun at the annual meeting of the Society for Biblical Literature in November 2022 on the effects that Dr. Norman Gottwald's presidential address given at SBL 30 years ago, [Social Class as an Analytic and Hermeneutical Category in Biblical Studies](https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/presidentialaddresses/JBL112_1_1Gottwald1992.pdf), has had on the role of class analysis in Biblical studies. The gathering will consist of seven prepared remarks (speakers noted below), interspersed by facilitated small group discussion.
