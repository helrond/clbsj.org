This online seminar will continue discussions begun at the Society for Biblical Literature annual meeting on the effects that Dr. Norman Gottwald's 1992 presidential address, [Social Class as an Analytic and Hermeneutical Category in Biblical Studies](https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/presidentialaddresses/JBL112_1_1Gottwald1992.pdf), has had on the role of class analysis in Biblical studies. The gathering will consist of seven prepared remarks (speakers noted below), interspersed by facilitated small group discussion.
