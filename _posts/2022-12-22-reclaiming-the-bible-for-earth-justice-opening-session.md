title: Reclaiming the Bible for Earth Justice -- Opening Session
series: lenten-detox
time: '7:30PM Eastern Time'
---
This year, the Lenten Bible Detox Series will examine the biblical roots of theologies that separate humans from the rest of creation, which have often been misused to justify environmental devastation. In solidarity with the urgent movements for climate justice and biodiversity preservation, we will excavate and reclaim a Biblical understanding of earth justice.

Our opening session on February 28, 2023 will be led by CLBJS Board Member Gale Yee. Dr. Yee will start our session out with an overview of the problem of Climate Change Denial, a position which is so often couched in biblical terms. What is the political and ideological history of this stance, and where does the Bible fit into this? Dr. Yee will provide an overview of science skepticism, religious fundamentalism and right wing political movements, and will explore the role that toxic biblical misinterpretation plays in keeping these ideas in play.
