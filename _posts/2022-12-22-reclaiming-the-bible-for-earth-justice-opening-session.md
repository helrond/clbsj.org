title: Reclaiming the Bible for Earth Justice -- Opening Session
series: lenten-detox
time: '7:30PM Eastern Time'
---
This year, the Lenten Bible Detox Series will examine the biblical roots of theologies that separate humans from the rest of creation, which have often been misused to justify environmental devastation. In solidarity with the urgent movements for climate justice and biodiversity preservation, we will excavate and reclaim a Biblical understanding of earth justice.

Our opening session on February 28, 2023 will be led by Gale Yee. Other speakers will include  Miguel de la Torre, Rachel Mikva, Brian Tipton, and more to be announced. Register for this session or check [clbsj.org/events/lenten-detox](https://clbsj.org/events/lenten-detox/) for updates!
