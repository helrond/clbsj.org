In honor of Black History Month, CLBSJ is hosing a roundtable discussion on the role of the Bible in Black History. We will discuss how it has been both a source of guidance for racial justice movements and a tool of oppression â€” and what can be done to draw out the former and disarm the latter. Speakers will include Layla Jones, Zoe Greenberg and Rev. Dr. Eric Thomas. The evening will be hosted by Sr. Sharifa Meytung.
