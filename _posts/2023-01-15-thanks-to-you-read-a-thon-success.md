title: 'Thanks to You: READ-A-THON SUCCESS!!'
---
The CLBSJ Board is thrilled to report that we have reached our end-of-the-year fundraising goal of $25,000 through our "Will Read for Justice" Read-a-Thon! WOW!! _**Thank you so much to everyone who helped make this happen!!!**_

The Read-a-thon was launched in response to a challenge from a donor to raise $25,000 in our year-end giving campaign. She offered to match this gift dollar for dollar if we could do it. And we did it! This is more than double the amount of money that we have raised in our end-of-year appeals in the past, not including the match. More importantly: we had fun, learned and made connections while doing it!

Do you have feedback about the Read-a-thon? Would you like to help make it a tradition? All are invited to [fill out this survey](https://forms.gle/4KpFREXk7DhgsUX76) or send your thoughts to clbsjorg@gmail.com.

It takes a village to build an organization â€” and it takes an inspired community to animate emerging Biblical scholarship with and for grassroots, justice-oriented audiences. Thank you for the part you are playing in CLBSJ's emerging circle!
