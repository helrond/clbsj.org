  Deliverance belongs to the Lord! Jonah, Jesus and the Possibilities of
  Environmental Healing
time: '7:30pm Eastern Time'
series: lenten-detox
---
In this session, Rev. Dr. Brian Fiu Kolia, a second-generation Australian-born Samoan, will share about the role of indigenous worldviews in detoxing from anthropocentric hermeneutical tendencies. He will draw from his research on “The I’a Tele (Great Fish) and the Search for Jonah: A Fāgogo Reading of [Jonah 1:17-2:10](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=542899050), in which he engages traditional Samoan culture to explore what the Great Fish may have been experiencing when it swallowed Jonah, and what message the text has for us today in light of the impending climate catastrophe. Dr. Kolia will be joined by Rev. Dr. Molambia Peggy Kabonde of the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians, who will offer a response based on the climate justice work that she is engaged in, and reflect on the message that the Passion story holds for those who have ears to hear the suffering of Momma Earth.
