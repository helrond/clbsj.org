Sometimes hope-inspiring, sometimes trauma-inducing, the Book of Revelation has some of the most complex history of interpretation of any book in the Bible. In this session, Dr. Crystal Hall will focus on the story of the Earth who comes to the aid of the Heavenly Woman in [Revelation 12:13-17](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=543409614), and how this image might serve as a resource for reclaiming the Bible for earth justice. Not merely the “environment” in which the action unfolds, Earth will be read as a character who has agency and takes action, especially in the context of Hebrew Testament precedents.
