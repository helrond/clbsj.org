In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, our May Scholar-Activist Encounter will feature Dr. Yii-Jan Lin in dialogue with Dr. Gale Yee. They will discuss Dr. Lin’s recent effort to innovate a way of "writing" biblical texts that responds to the needs of anti-racism movements today. Her writing of [Hebrews 11:1–12:2](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=548882538) draws from her research into the themes of lineage, ancestors, migration, faith, and rest in a promised land which are embedded into the original text, and weaves them together with contemporary historical data. Dr. Lin and Dr. Yee will explore the motives for and implications of this project for faith and activist communities. 

**Optional Advanced Reading:** “Our Cloud of Witnesses: A Writing of Hebrews 11:1–12:2 in Memory of the Asian and Asian American Women Killed 16 March 2021” is available for open access download through the end of May at [scholarlypublishingcollective.org](https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/sblpress/jbl/article/141/4/761/342705/Our-Cloud-of-Witnesses-A-Writing-of-Hebrews-11-1).
