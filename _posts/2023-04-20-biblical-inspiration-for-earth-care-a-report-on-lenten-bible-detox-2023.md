title: 'Biblical Inspiration for Earth Care: A Report on Lenten Bible Detox 2023 '
author: Amy Dalton
---
This Lent, the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice (CLBSJ) reckoned with the way the Bible has been misused to justify and promote environmental devastation. Through this process, we excavated and honed readings of scripture that emphasize the Divine desire for humans to live in healthy harmony with all of creation. Video archives from these sessions are freely available at clbsj.org/events/lenten-detox for individuals and communities seeking biblical inspiration for this Earth Day weekend. Scriptures discussed include Genesis 1:26-28 (blessing for dominion), Genesis 6-9 (Noah and the flood), Jonah 1:17-2:10 (Jonah's prayer from the whale's belly), Mark 4:1-15 (Parable of the Sower), Romans 8:19-22 (creation's "enslavement to destruction") and Revelation 12:13-17 (the Earth who comes to the aid of the Heavenly Woman), 21:1-3 (the new heaven and the new earth), and 22:1-2 (the River of Life). Below is a short summary of each session.

Session 1 featured Hebrew Bible scholar Dr. Gale Yee and Episcopal priest Rev. Laurel Dykstra providing perspectives on how climate change denialism makes use of the Bible. Dr. Yee provided a historical summary of explicit climate change denialism within white evangelical communities, identifying social and political forces dating back to the mid 19th century that laid the foundation for what we are experiencing currently. Rev. Dykstra gave a summary of the ways that less visible forms of climate change denialism thrives also within white liberal Christian communities.

Session 2 featured Dr. Miguel De La Torre and Rabbi Dr. Rachel Mikva taking us on a deep dive into the challenges and opportunities that the creation stories raise, especially Genesis 1:26-28. Dr. De La Torre focused on naming the risks of dominion/stewardship and anthropocentrism, and how marginal perspectives on the text including indigenous, feminist, and global south perspectives, can unearth more nuanced readings. Rabbi Mikva discussed how both the text itself and Jewish interpretive tradition contain resources for disarming the dangers embedded in these texts.

Session 3 featured Dr. Presian Burroughs presenting an alternative translation and understanding of Romans 8:19-22 which dignifies the earth and opens up space for human agency in countering environmental devastation. She shared details of the environmental crises that were going on within the Roman Empire and discussed how this contexts informs our understanding of Paul's intentions. Dr. Erin Lothes offered a response based on her organizing within the Laudato Si Movement. She highlighted sections of the Pope's encyclical which engage in the sort of corrective "detoxing" work that CLBSJ is doing, and shared about how Laudato Si works to cultivate inspired action of the sort that Paul is calling for in Romans 8:19-22.

Session 4 featured Hebrew Testament Scholar Jaime Waters and New Testament Scholar Brian James Tipton discussing ways of understanding non-human animals in the Bible. Dr. Waters discussed the role of birds in the flood story, and highlighted texts and themes that show them to have acted as partners with humans in navigating this crisis. Dr. Tipton shared about his "sibling hermeneutic" through which texts are read with a commitment to seeing humans and non-human animals as siblings in the struggle to survive. He focused specifically on the role of birds in the Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:1-15) and explored how the significance of the passage changes when we consider the actual experience that birds were having trying to live within that society.

Session 5 featured Crystal Hall and Ched Myers exploring the often overlooked environmental messages contained within the book of Revelation. Dr. Hall discussed the misreading of Revelation that has been propagated by dispensationalist theology, identifying the specific confusions that allow for this misreading and discussing the way the misreading drives a sense of separation between humans and the earth. She then presented the story of how the Earth came to the aid of the Heavenly Woman in Revelation 12:13-17 as a powerful counterpoint to this toxic interpretive tradition. Prof. Myers focused on the beloved texts regarding the new heaven and the new earth (21:1-3), and the River of Life (22:1-2), highlighting the way understanding these texts within the contexts of the prophetic tradition and the Roman empire reveals the powerful call for humans to participate in the renewal of the Earth.

Session 6 featured Brian Fiu Kolia and Peggy Mulambya-Kabonde discussing how the stories of Jonah and Jesus reveal ways of understanding how God is engaging the whole earth in delivering us through this crisis. Dr. Kolia utilized methods of understanding rooted in his Samoan heritage to read the story of Jonah in a way that draws out the agenda of the Great Fish, and drew connections between the way that Jonah was interloping on the Great Fish's territory to the ways that our current system facilitates colonialism and exploitation. Dr. Mulambya-Kabonde shared about the urgency of the moment and discussed the work that the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians is doing to propagate liberating theologies that can support the action that is required of us now.

Through the detox journey, we also assembled an inspired series of connected action opportunities, which can be accessed here.
