This year's Black August series will be focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. 

This year, Black August sessions will take place on Thursday evenings. **Register for this session to receive updates on the entire series:** {% include registration-button.html link="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEpd-upqz4vHNzlH__MQ-N19mSVnMDLn2Sm#/registration" %}
