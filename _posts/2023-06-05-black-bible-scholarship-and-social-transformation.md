Co-author of _The Genesis of Liberation: Biblical Interpretation in the Antebellum Narratives of the Enslaved_, Dr. Rodney Sadler will give an overview of recent efforts to recover the early history of Black biblical interpretation, and comment on how these enslaved interpreters have contributed to contemporary biblical understanding. In particular, he will speak to how "freedom hermeneutics" can inform our efforts to dismantle whiteness and to develop anti-racist understandings of the Bible as a whole, as well as biblical traditions such as the Sabbath.

This year's Black August series is focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. The series is being curated by Hugh Page (co-editor of _Black Scholars Matter_) and Angela Parker (co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod_), along with Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Sherly Fabre, Warren Cooper, Carolyn Grice and Amy Dalton. Bios are available at [clbsj.org/events/black-august/](https://clbsj.org/events/black-august/). We are grateful for the co-sponsorship of [Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary](https://www.jcsts.org/) and the [Community of Living Traditions](https://www.facebook.com/CLTMultifaith/).
