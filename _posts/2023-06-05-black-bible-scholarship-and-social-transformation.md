This year's Black August series will focus on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. As part of this journey, we will engage with the books _Black Scholars Matter: Visions, Struggles, and Hopes in Africana Biblical Studies_ and _Bitter the Chastening Rod: Africana Biblical Interpretation after Stony the Road We Trod in the Age of BLM, SayHerName, and MeToo_.

Sessions will take place on Thursday evenings in August starting on August 3. **Register for the first session to receive updates on the entire series:** {% include registration-button.html link="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEpd-upqz4vHNzlH__MQ-N19mSVnMDLn2Sm#/registration" %}

This series is co-sponsored by the Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary, and is being curated by Rev. Dr. Hugh Page, Rev. Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Warren Cooper, Sherly Fabre and Amy Dalton. Bios are available at [clbsj.org/events/black-august/](https://clbsj.org/events/black-august/)
