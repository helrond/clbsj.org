This year's Black August series will be focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. 

This year, Black August sessions will take place on Thursday evenings. Register for this session to receive updates on the entire series:

Black August 2023 is being curated by Rev. Dr. Hugh Page, Rev. Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Warren Cooper, Sherly Fabre and Amy Dalton. Bios are available at https://clbsj.org/events/black-august/
