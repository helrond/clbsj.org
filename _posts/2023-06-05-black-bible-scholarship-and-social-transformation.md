**Starting At the Roots:
Slavery, Resistance and Biblical Understanding**

Co-author of [_The Genesis of Liberation: Biblical Interpretation in the Antebellum Narratives of the Enslaved_](https://www.wjkbooks.com/Products/0664230539/the-genesis-of-liberation.aspx), Dr. Rodney Sadler will explore with us how enslavement era biblical interpreters helped shape contemporary biblical interpretation. In particular, he will speak to how these "freedom hermeneutics" can inform our efforts to dismantle whiteness and to develop anti-racist understandings of the Bible as a whole, as well as biblical traditions such as the Sabbath.

Dr. Sadler will be joined by respondent Faith Cook, a North Carolina-based anti-racism activist. The session will be hosted and facilitated by Nicholas Johnson, CLBSJ President and Board Chair.

This year's Black August series is focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. The series is being curated by Hugh Page (co-editor of _Black Scholars Matter_) and Angela Parker (co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod_), along with Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Sherly Fabre, Warren Cooper, Carolyn Grice and Amy Dalton. Bios are available at [clbsj.org/events/black-august/](https://clbsj.org/events/black-august/). We are grateful for the co-sponsorship of [Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary](https://www.jcsts.org/) and the [Community of Living Traditions](https://www.facebook.com/CLTMultifaith/).
