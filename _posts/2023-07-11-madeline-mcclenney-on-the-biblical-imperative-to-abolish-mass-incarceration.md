**The Biblical Imperative to Abolish Mass Incarceration:
Why We Must Seek Mass Clemency or Stop Preaching the Gospel**

President and founder of [ExodusFoundation.Org](https://exodusfoundation.org/), Rev. Dr. Madeline McClenney will explore what the Exodus tradition, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and other biblical stories have to say to us in this age of racialized criminalization and mass incarceration. Dr. McClenney has been tireless in working to integrate her training as a Hebrew Testament scholar with her work for fundamental system change. She will share about how she is doing that, and how we can support and participate in it. 

Dr. McClenney will be joined in conversation with former political prisoner M. Ashanti Alston. The session will be hosted and facilitated by CLBSJ Board Member Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung.

This year's Black August series is focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. The series is being curated by Hugh Page (co-editor of _Black Scholars Matter_) and Angela Parker (co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod_), along with Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Sherly Fabre, Warren Cooper, Carolyn Grice and Amy Dalton. Bios are available at [clbsj.org/events/black-august/](https://clbsj.org/events/black-august/). We are grateful for the co-sponsorship of [Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary](https://www.jcsts.org/) and the [Community of Living Traditions](https://www.facebook.com/CLTMultifaith/).
