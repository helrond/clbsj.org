**Womanist Biblical Interpretation:
Exposing Whiteness, Critiquing Harmful Texts, Transforming the Conversation**

Drawing from her articles ‘To Think Better Than We Have Been Trained’: Thirty Years Later (BTCR) and On Leaving But Not Going Far (BSM), Rev. Dr. Renita Weems will share about her experience challenging racism and white supremacy within the field of Biblical scholarship. The first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. in Hebrew Bible, Dr. Weems has been consistently opening up space to face and wrestle with the layers of violence embedded into biblical texts. She will discuss the relationship between this work, and accessing the power of the Bible for liberation.

This year's Black August series is focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. The series is being curated by Hugh Page (co-editor of _Black Scholars Matter_) and Angela Parker (co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod_), along with Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Sherly Fabre, Warren Cooper, Carolyn Grice and Amy Dalton. Bios are available at [clbsj.org/events/black-august/](https://clbsj.org/events/black-august/). We are grateful for the co-sponsorship of [Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary](https://www.jcsts.org/) and the [Community of Living Traditions](https://www.facebook.com/CLTMultifaith/).
