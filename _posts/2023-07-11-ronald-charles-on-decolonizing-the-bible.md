Decolonizing the Bible:
How Haiti’s language, culture and revolutionary legacy can inform a decolonial biblical understanding

Drawing from his articles, “Moving In Between Places and Academic Disciplines” (BSM) and “Reading Romans in Greek: Translating and Commenting on it in Haitian Creole” (BTCR), Dr. Ronald Charles will share about his quest to forge biblical scholarship that speaks generativeley into the lives of struggling communities in Haiti and the Haitian diaspora. In specific, he will discuss the ways that translation, both between languages and contexts, can either be mobilized toward silencing and conformity, or toward decolonization and solidarity.

This year's Black August series is focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. The series is being curated by Hugh Page (co-editor of _Black Scholars Matter_) and Angela Parker (co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod_), along with Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Sherly Fabre, Warren Cooper, Carolyn Grice and Amy Dalton. Bios are available at [clbsj.org/events/black-august/](https://clbsj.org/events/black-august/). We are grateful for the co-sponsorship of [Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary](https://www.jcsts.org/) and the [Community of Living Traditions](https://www.facebook.com/CLTMultifaith/).
