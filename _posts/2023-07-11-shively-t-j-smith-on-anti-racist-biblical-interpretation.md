**Anti-Racist Biblical Interpretation:
How Activists, Allies and Colleagues can Connect with and Amplify the Work of Black Biblical Scholars**

Drawing from her article,  "Preliminary Thoughts: The Hermeneutical Dilemmas of the Allies, Colleagues and Guild of African American Biblical Scholar-Teachers," published in Black Scholars Matter, Dr. Shively Smith will outline a set of principles by which those working to end racism can participate in the transformation of biblical understanding that Black/Africana biblical scholars are striving to animate. She will give examples of the application of these principles, drawing from her own research and engagement with historical and contemporary anti-racism organizing.

This year's Black August series is focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. The series is being curated by Hugh Page (co-editor of _Black Scholars Matter_) and Angela Parker (co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod_), along with Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Sherly Fabre, Warren Cooper, Carolyn Grice and Amy Dalton. Bios are available at [clbsj.org/events/black-august/](https://clbsj.org/events/black-august/). We are grateful for the co-sponsorship of [Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary](https://www.jcsts.org/) and the [Community of Living Traditions](https://www.facebook.com/CLTMultifaith/).
