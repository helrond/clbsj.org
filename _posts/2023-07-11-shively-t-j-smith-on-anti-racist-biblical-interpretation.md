**Anti-Racist Biblical Interpretation:
How Activists, Allies and Colleagues can Connect with and Amplify the Work of Black Biblical Scholars**

Drawing from her article, "Preliminary Thoughts: The Hermeneutical Dilemmas of the Allies, Colleagues and Guild of African American Biblical Scholar-Teachers," published in Black Scholars Matter, Dr. Shively Smith will outline a set of principles by which those working to end racism can participate in the transformation of biblical understanding that Black/Africana biblical scholars are striving to animate. She will give examples of the application of these principles, drawing from her own research and engagement with historical and contemporary anti-racism organizing.

Dr. Smith will be joined in conversation by Rev. Jermaine Ross-Allam from the Center for the Repair of Historical Harms of the Presbyterian Church USA. The session will be hosted and facilitated by Ericka Dunbar, co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod: Africana Biblical Interpretation after Stony the Road We Trod in the Age of BLM, SayHerName, and MeToo._

This year's Black August series is focused on how the experiences of struggle to overcome racism, slavery and mass incarceration have informed Black/Africana biblical interpretation, and how Black scholars are using the understanding embedded in these experiences to reshape the field of biblical scholarship. The series is being curated by Hugh Page (co-editor of _Black Scholars Matter_) and Angela Parker (co-editor of _Bitter the Chastening Rod_), along with Nicholas Johnson, Sr. Sharifa Vernice Meytung, Sherly Fabre, Warren Cooper, Carolyn Grice and Amy Dalton.

Smith Theological Seminary](https://www.jcsts.org/) and the [Community of Living Traditions](https://www.facebook.com/CLTMultifaith/).
