_**Please join with CLBSJ to celebrate and extend critical engagement with the Bible!**_

As students of all ages are resuming their studies, CLBSJ is holding our second annual Read-a-Thon: a participatory fundraiser and public awareness campaign to celebrate and extend critical, justice-oriented Biblical study and engagement. We are calling on all bibliophiles, autodidacts, bible nerds, scholars, preachers, teachers and faith-filled activists to join in to make the read-a-thon a success! There are several ways you can participate:

**Donate to support the Readers:** Gifts of any size will help us to reach our goal of $25,000. You can make a per-page pledge for a specific reader, or you can make a flat donation to the entire campaign. If you choose to support a specific reader, use their page goal to calculate how much you want to pledge. For example, if your reader's goal is to read 500 pages, for example, a dime per page would equal a $50 gift. You can make your donation at [go.rallyup.com/clbsj-readathon2023](https://go.rallyup.com/clbsj-readathon2023/Campaign/Details)

**Become a Reader:** You can read anything that is currently on your reading list -- books, articles, pamphlets... the Bible! The only difference from normal is that you will "dedicate" this reading to support CLBSJ, and ask your friends and family to help you in that process. You will be asked to tally the pages you have read and report them periodically through the interface on RallyUp. By registering as a Reader through RallyUp, you'll receive a personal fundraising page that makes it incredibly easy to tell your friends and family about CLBSJ and ask them to join you in supporting its unique ministry. For anyone who signs up, CLBSJ Staff and Board members will reach out with tips, troubleshooting help and team spirit. Sign up at [go.rallyup.com/c/clbsj-readathon2023-reader](https://go.rallyup.com/c/clbsj-readathon2023-reader).

**Spread the Word:** Please use this campaign as an opportunity to spread awareness about the connection between the Bible, traditions of critical thinking, and movements for justice! We will be posting book lists, mini-reviews and other updates on [RallyUp](https://go.rallyup.com/clbsj-readathon2023) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/clbsj). Your help in sharing these posts will help CLBSJ reach others who share our passion for extending opportunities for critical, justice-oriented Bible study.
