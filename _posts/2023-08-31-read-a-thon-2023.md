title: Let’s Read for Justice! Read-a-Thon 2023
---
_**Please join with CLBSJ to celebrate and extend critical engagement with the Bible!**_

Last November, CLBSJ held our first participatory fundraiser – a 'read-a-thon' in which friends of CLBSJ came together to harness our love of edgy books and critical thinking in support of CLBSJ's educational ministry. This year we are doing it again, but a little earlier, during September and October. As students of all ages are resuming their studies, we ask you to join with us to make the read-a-thon a success! There are several ways you can participate:

**Become a Reader:** You can read anything that is currently on your reading list -- books, articles, pamphlets... the Bible! The only difference from normal is that you will "dedicate" this reading to support CLBSJ, and ask your friends and family to help you in that process. You will be asked to tally the pages you have read and report them periodically through the interface on RallyUp. By registering as a Reader through RallyUp, you'll receive a personal fundraising page that makes it incredibly easy to tell your friends and family about CLBSJ and ask them to join you in supporting it's unique ministry. For anyone who signs up, CLBSJ staff and Board members will reach out with tips, troubleshooting help and team spirit.

**Donate to support the Readers:** Gifts of any size will help us to reach out goal of $25,000. You can make a per-page pledge for a specific reader, or you can make a flat donation to the entire campaign. If you choose to support a specific reader, use their page goal to calculate how much you want to pledge. For example, if your reader's goal is to read 500 pages, for example, a dime per page would equal a $50 gift.

**Save the Date!** On Thursday, October 5, in solidarity with Banned Books Week, we will gather for “A Celebration of Banned Books and Critical Thinking.” Let's lift up, defend and promote the edgy books and critical thinking traditions that have shaped us as activists and Biblical interpreters. The event will be a participatory gathering, with members of the CLBSJ community sharing about the reading we are doing, and how it is impacting our understanding of the Bible and our work for justice. Anyone who is participating in the Read-a-thon is welcome to volunteer to present. _Details about this event will be posted soon._

**Spread the Word:** Please consider sharing this campaign with anyone you know who shares your commitment to reclaiming the Bible for social justice. The Readers will be sharing mini-reviews of the books they are reading, which will help spread awareness about the connection between the Bible, traditions of critical thinking, and movements for justice.
