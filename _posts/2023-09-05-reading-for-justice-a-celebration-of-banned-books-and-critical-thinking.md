_A participatory fundraiser to help CLBSJ extend access to critical biblical engagement_

As part of our 2023 read-a-thon, and in solidarity with Banned Books Week, CLBSJ invites you to gather in support of the edgy books and critical thinking traditions that have shaped us as activists and Biblical interpreters. The event will be a participatory gathering, with members of the CLBSJ community sharing about the reading we are doing, and how it is impacting our understanding of the Bible and our work for justice. 

Registration is a sliding scale fee, starting at $5. All proceeds go directly to CLBSJ's work. Click on the orange button to register and make your gift!
