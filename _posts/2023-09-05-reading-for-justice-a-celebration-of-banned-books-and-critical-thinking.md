title: 'Reading for Justice: A Celebration of Banned Books and Critical Thinking'
---
As part of our 2023 Read-a-thon, we will gather in support of the edgy books and critical thinking traditions that have shaped us as activists and Biblical interpreters. The event will be a participatory gathering, with members of the CLBSJ community sharing about the reading we are doing, and how it is impacting our understanding of the Bible and our work for justice. Anyone who is participating in the Read-a-thon is welcome to volunteer to present.
