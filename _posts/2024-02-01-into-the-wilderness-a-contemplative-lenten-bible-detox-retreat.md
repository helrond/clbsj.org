title: 'Into the Wilderness: A Contemplative Lenten Bible Detox Retreat'
time: '10:00am Eastern Time'
series: lenten-detox
---
In the past few months we’ve seen in unprecedented scale the destructive impact that violent misuse of the Bible can wreak on vulnerable populations. Facing the shadow side of our scriptural traditions is no longer just a personally fulfilling thing to do. It is an absolute necessity if we are to be able to act with integrity in “the fierce urgency of now.” CLBSJ invites all who are struggling to find traction in this moment to join us for a half-day Bible Detox retreat. Following in Jesus’ footsteps and drawing from the tradition of contemplative Christianity, we will mark a path into the wilderness to face down the demons that are coopting and confusing our scriptural traditions today. 

This will be a participatory retreat. Registrants will be given an opportunity to help shape the event by sharing which toxified Bible verses that they have been working with, or feel a need to work with. Register today to receive more details:
