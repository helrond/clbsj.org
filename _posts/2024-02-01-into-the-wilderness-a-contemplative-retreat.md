In the past few months we’ve seen in unprecedented scale the destructive impact that violent misuse of the Bible can wreak on vulnerable populations. Facing the shadow side of our scriptural traditions is no longer just a personally fulfilling thing to do. It is an absolute necessity if we are to be able to act with integrity in “the fierce urgency of now.” CLBSJ invites all who are struggling to find traction in this moment to join us for a half-day Bible Detox retreat. Following in Jesus’ footsteps and drawing from the tradition of contemplative Christianity, we will mark a path into the wilderness to face down the demons that are coopting and confusing our scriptural traditions today. 

This will be a participatory retreat! The scriptures we will work with are [Joshua 6](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=576032633 ) (the story of the siege of Jericho) and [John 14](https://bible.oremus.org/?ql=576153395) (in which Jesus states, "No one comes to the Father except through me"). We encourage you to read these scriptures in advance. You are welcome to bring your preferred translations, as well as any other resources that have been helpful to you in understanding these passages. We also encourage you to [watch the archive of our January 27 session](https://clbsj.org/events/2024/01/27/the-bible-and-settler-colonialism-in-palestine-and-beyond/) in which Mitri Raheb spoke about the use of Joshua 6 in the settler colonialist takeover of Palestine.
