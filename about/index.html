  <p>The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice is a media and organizing hub that links biblical scholarship with our movements for social justice. We weave connections between scripturally informed scholars, students, clergy, activists, artists and community organizers who often work separately and without the rich resources and insights they are capable of offering one another.</p>

<p>We do this by providing resources — including books, periodicals, archives and electronic materials — and by curating online educational programming on topics and problems central to furthering the critical study of the Bible and other sacred texts and empowered engagement with the scripture in our justice work today.</p>

<p>We aim to create a synergy of theory and practice in a dynamic action-reflection climate that renders justice-oriented biblical scholarship as exciting and accessible to specialist and lay audiences alike.</p>
