Over the past twenty years, as faculty member and administrator, he has been

fellowship initiative for Women and Scholars-of-Color (the Moreau Postdoctoral

helped create the University’s Department of _Africana_ Studies in 2005; and is
part of the team in the Provost’s Office working on projects related to inclusive
