John H. Elliott (Dr. Theol., Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität, Münster, Germany) was known internationally for his research on 1 Peter and as a leading proponent of the social-scientific study of the Bible. He taught and wrote extensively on Jesus and the early Church in their historical and cultural contexts during tenures at the University of San Francisco (1967-2001) and Concordia Seminary, St. Louis MO (1963-1967). His publications include _The Christ Life: Jesus Christ the Sacrament and Sacramental Living_, _The Elect and the Holy_, _A Home for the Homeless_, _The Augsburg New Testament Commentary on 1-2 Peter/Jude_, _What is Social-Scientific Criticism?_, _1 Peter_ (Anchor Bible 37B), _Conflict, Community, and Honor: 1 Peter in Social-Scientific Perspective_, _La Primera Carta de Pedro_ and, as editor, _Social-Scientific Criticism of the New Testament and Its Social World_. He also authored a four-volume work titled _Beware The Evil Eye: The Evil Eye in the Bible and the Ancient World_ (Wipf & Stock). Rev.
