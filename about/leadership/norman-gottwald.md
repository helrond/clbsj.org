Norman K. Gottwald (1926 - 2022) was Professor Emeritus of Biblical Studies at New York Theological Seminary and taught previously at the Graduate Theological Union and Andover Newton Theological School. His most influential book is _The Tribes of Yahweh: A Sociology of the Religion of Liberated Israel, 1250-1050 B.C.E._ (1979), a celebrated study of the origins of ancient Israel as an indigenous peasant uprising. His other writings include _The Hebrew Bible: A Socio-Literary Introduction_, _The Hebrew Bible in Its Social World and in Ours_, _The Politics of Ancient Israel_, and, as co-author, _The Bible and Liberation: Political and Social Hermeneutics_. Gottwald pioneered the use of social theory and method in biblical studies. He was a world-wide lecturer on the critical relevance of the Bible to contemporary social struggles and a citizen activist in numerous civil rights, anti-war, and pro-labor movements and organizations. As an ordained minister of American Baptist Churches USA, he was a strong advocate of popular biblical study committed to social change.
