Rick Ufford-Chase is a faith-rooted activist and author with a long
history of developing popular education tools. He currently serves as
the Institutional Advancement Officer for Johnson C Smith Theological
Seminary based on Atlanta, GA, and volunteers with the Grassroots
Reparations Campaign and Proyecto Faro (an immigrant led advocacy
organization in Rockland County, NY), and he is on the Board of the
Sweetwater Cultural Center (an indigenous cultural organization that was
launched through gift of property of a former Presbyterian Church). He
and his wife Kitty served for 12 years as Co-Directors of Stony Point
Center, which houses CLBSJ's primary collection. In this role, they
founded the Community of Living Traditions, a multifaith intentional
community committed to the pursuit of justice and peace. Rick also
served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church
(USA) from 2004 to 2006, as Executive Director of the Presbyterian Peace
Fellowship, and as an organizer and popular educator on the U.S./Mexico
border for twenty years. Rick is the author of _Faithful Resistance:
Gospel Visions for the Church in a Time of Empire_. He lives with his
wife Kitty in a cabin in Northern VT, where nowadays he can often be
found snowshoeing in the woods with their dog Riley.
