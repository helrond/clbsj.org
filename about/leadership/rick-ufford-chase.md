Rick Ufford-Chase and his wife Kitty are the Co-Directors of Stony Point Conference Center, which houses the primary collections of the CLBSJ. He worked as an organizer and popular educator on the U.S./Mexico border for twenty years. Since 2008, Rick and Kitty have been working with others to create the Community of Living Traditions, a multifaith, residential community committed to the study and practice of Nonviolence and located at Stony Point Center in the Lower Hudson River Valley. Rick served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) from 2004 to 2006. He also serves as the Executive Director of the Presbyterian Peace Fellowship. Rick has been deeply interested in the intersection between our faith, the challenge of responding to violence in our time, and the work of partnering with those from other religious traditions to protect and extend basic human rights to all people.
