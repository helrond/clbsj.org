Thomas E. Boomershine (PhD, Union Theological Seminary) is an emeritus professor of
New Testament and a United Methodist elder. He has been an activist as a biblical
storyteller, educator (New York and United Theological Seminaries), author, and
community organizer of the Network of Biblical Storytellers, International, and the Bible
in Ancient and Modern Media research group in SBL. His detailed studies of the Gospels
as ancient storytelling across the boundaries of the cultures of Israel and the Gentile
Greco-Roman world are a foundation for peacemaking in the modern world. His research
and advocacy have also helped to initiate the development of performance criticism as a
methodology for biblical study. His books, _Story Journey: An Introduction to the Gospel
as Storytelling_ (1988) and _The Messiah of Peace_ (2015), are resources for the
reconception of the Gospels as stories of peacemaking and of biblical storytelling as a
strategy for non-violent resistance to violence and warfare.
