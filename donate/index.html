<h3>Norman Gottwald Memorial Fund</h3>
<p>We are heartbroken at the passing of Rev. Dr. Norman Gottwald on March 11, 2022. Norman was, in many ways, the primary architect of the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice. Please join us in remembering him and carrying forward his vision by donating to the Norman Gottwald Memorial Fund.</p>
