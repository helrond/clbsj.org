CLBSJ has been built almost entirely through individual donations and pledges — thank you so much for investing in this experiment!

<h3>Fall 2021 Campaign</h3>
<b>Amazing news!</b> Board members and friends of CLBSJ have assembled a $33,000 challenge gift, and would like to see it matched dollar for dollar to launch CLBSJ into our second decade on strong footing. <b><i>Can you make an end-of-the-year donation to help unlock this gift?</i></b>

From CLBSJ Board members Cass Shaw and Nick Johnson: "CLBSJ nurtures the sparks that come when we can connect with the power of the Living Word to speak into and animate our struggles for justice, rights and dignity for all creatures, and for the earth itself. We urge you to help us meet our year end challenge and empower CLBSJ to carry forward this vital work!" <a href="https://clbsj.org/news/2021/11/23/challenge-help-launch-clbsj-into-our-second-decade-on-strong-footing/">Read Cass and Nick's full letter here</a>
