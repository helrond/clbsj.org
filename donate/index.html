<h2>The "Re-Potting" Fund</h2>

<p>As we collectively make our way through these unprecedented times, it
has been said that "every organization is now a startup." The CLBSJ
Board is embracing this reality, and has recently decided to “re-ground”
with a focus on two priorities: (1) solidifying our participation in
local and regional organizing in the Lower Hudson Valley, where our
flagship collection is located, and (2) forging online encounters
between Biblically-based scholars and activists that speak into the
needs of this time.</p>

<p>In order to pull off this plan, we need your help! CLBSJ is entirely
funded by donations from individuals, and we need to raise $10,000 to
make our budget for the rest of 2020. A generous donor has offered to
match all gifts made to the "re-potting fund," up to $5,000. Please help
us reach this goal!</p>

<h2>How to Give</h2>
