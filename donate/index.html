thank you so much for investing in this experiment!

<h3>Norman Gottwald Memorial Fund</h3>
<p>We are heartbroken at the passing of Rev. Dr. Norman Gottwald on March 11, 2022.
Norman was, in many ways, the primary architect of the Center and Library for
the Bible and Social Justice. Please join us in remembering him and carrying forward
his vision by donating to the Norman Gottwald Memorial Fund.</p>

<h3>Capacity Building Campaign</h3>
<p><b>Amazing news!</b> Board members and friends of CLBSJ have assembled a $30,000
challenge gift, and would like to see it matched dollar for dollar to launch
CLBSJ into our second decade on strong footing. <b><i>Can you make a donation in
the new year to help us unlock this gift?</i></b></p>

<p>CLBSJ Board members Cass Shaw and Nick Johnson write:
<i>"CLBSJ nurtures the sparks that come when we can connect with the power of the
Living Word to speak into and animate our struggles for justice, rights and
dignity for all creatures, and for the earth itself. We urge you to help us
meet this challenge and empower CLBSJ to carry forward this vital work!"</i>
