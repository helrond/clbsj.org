  <h3>Fall Campaign: Will Read for Justice!</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <img class="image-right float-right" src="/img/ChurchPeopleInTheStruggle.jpeg"/>
    <p>
      The Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice (CLBSJ) has been
      challenged by a donor to raise $25,000 before the end of the year. To
      help us meet this goal and have fun doing it, we are "coming out" as
      hopeless bibliophiles and embarking on a Fall Read-a-Thon! Together,
      Board members and friends of CLBSJ have committed to read at least 5,000
      pages. <strong>Can you help us reach our goal by
      donating to support the read-a-thon?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
      You can make a per-page pledge for your favorite reader, or you can make
      a flat donation to the entire campaign. Check out details and pledge to 
      support your favorite reader on our campaign page at RallyUp.com.

<h3>Norman Gottwald Memorial Fund</h3>
<p>We are heartbroken at the passing of Rev. Dr. Norman Gottwald on March 11, 2022. Norman was, in many ways, the primary architect of the Center and Library for the Bible and Social Justice. Please join us in remembering him and carrying forward his vision by donating to the Norman Gottwald Memorial Fund.</p>
