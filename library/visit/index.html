<p>We have a world-class collection of books, periodicals and other materials relating to biblical study and social justice.</p>

<p>The collection is available for use by scholars and activists from all walks of life, regardless of institutional or religious affiliation. Because we want our materials to be available at any time for research, we do not lend out books. The collection can be consulted on site only.</p>
